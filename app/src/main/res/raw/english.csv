"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"All praise belongs to Allah, Lord of all the worlds,"
"The Gracious, the Merciful,"
Master of the Day of Judgment.
Thee alone do we worship and Thee alone do we implore for help.
Guide us in the right path  — 
"The path of those on whom Thou hast bestowed (Thy) blessings, those who have not incurred (Thy) displeasure, and those who have not gone astray."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
Alif Lam Mim.
"This is a perfect Book; there is no doubt in it; (it is) a guidance for the righteous,"
"Who believe in the unseen and observe Prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them;"
"And who believe in that which has been revealed to thee, and that which was revealed before thee, and they have firm faith in what is (yet) to come."
It is they who follow the guidance of their Lord and it is they who shall prosper.
Those who have disbelieved  —  it being equal to them whether thou warn them or warn them not  —  they will not believe.
"Allah has set a seal on their hearts and their ears, and over their eyes is a covering; and for them is a great punishment."
"And of the people there are some who say, ‘We believe in Allah and the Last Day;’ while they are not believers at all."
"They would deceive Allah and those who believe, and they deceive none but themselves; only they perceive (it) not."
"In their hearts was a disease, and Allah has increased their disease to them; and for them is a grievous punishment because they lied."
"And when it is said to them: ‘Create not disorder on the earth,’ they say: ‘We are only promoters of peace.’"
"Beware! it is surely they who create disorder, but they do not perceive (it)."
"And when it is said to them, ‘Believe as (other) people have believed,’ they say: ‘Shall we believe as the foolish have believed?’ Beware! it is surely they that are foolish, but they do not know."
"And when they meet those who believe, they say: ‘We believe;’ but when they are alone with their ringleaders, they say: ‘We are certainly with you; we are only mocking.’"
"Allah will punish their mockery and will let them continue in their transgression, wandering blindly."
"These are they who have taken error in exchange for guidance; but their traffic has brought them no gain, nor are they rightly guided."
"Their case is like the case of a person who kindled a fire, and when it lighted up all around him, Allah took away their light and left them in thick darkness; they see not."
"(They are) deaf, dumb (and) blind; so they will not return."
"Or (it is) like a heavy rain from the clouds, wherein is thick darkness and thunder and lightning; they put their fingers into their ears because of the thunderclaps for fear of death, and Allah encompasses the disbelievers."
"The lightning might well-nigh snatch away their sight; whenever it shines upon them, they walk therein; and when it becomes dark to them, they stand still. And if Allah willed, He could take away their hearing and their sight; surely, Allah has the power to do all that He wills."
"O ye men, worship your Lord Who created you and those who were before you, that you may become righteous;"
"Who made the earth a bed for you, and the heaven a roof, and caused water to come down from the clouds and therewith brought forth fruits for your sustenance. Set not up, therefore, equals to Allah, while you know."
"And if you are in doubt as to what We have sent down to Our servant, then produce a Chapter like it, and call upon your helpers beside Allah, if you are truthful."
"But if you do (it) not  —  and never shall you do (it) —  then guard against the Fire, whose fuel is men and stones, (which is) prepared for the disbelievers."
"And give glad tidings to those who believe and do good works, that for them are Gardens beneath which flow streams. Whenever they are given a portion of fruit therefrom, they will say: ‘This is what was given us before,’ and gifts mutually resembling shall be brought to them. And they will have therein mates perfectly pure, and therein will they abide."
"Allah disdains not to give an illustration as small as a gnat or even smaller. Those who believe know that it is the truth from their Lord, while those who disbelieve say: ‘What does Allah mean by such an illustration?’ Many does He adjudge by it to be erring and many by it does He guide, and none does He adjudge thereby to be erring except the disobedient,"
"Who break the covenant of Allah after having established it, and cut asunder what Allah has bidden to be joined, and create disorder in the earth; it is these that are the losers."
"How can you disbelieve in Allah? When you were without life, He gave you life, and then He will cause you to die, then restore you to life, and then to Him shall you be made to return."
"He it is Who created for you all that is in the earth; then He turned towards the heavens, and He perfected them as seven heavens; and He knows all things."
"And when thy Lord said to the angels: ‘I am about to place a vicegerent in the earth,’ they said: ‘Wilt Thou place therein such as will cause disorder in it, and shed blood?  —  and we glorify Thee with Thy praise and extol Thy holiness.’ He answered: ‘I know what you know not.’"
"And He taught Adam all the names, then He put (the objects of) these (names) before the angels and said: ‘Tell Me the names of these, if you are right.’"
"They said: ‘Holy art Thou! No knowledge have we except what Thou hast taught us; surely, Thou art the All-Knowing, the Wise.’"
"He said: ‘O Adam, tell them their names;’ and when he had told them their names, He said: ‘Did I not say to you, I know the secrets of the heavens and of the earth, and I know what you reveal and what you conceal?’"
"And (remember the time) when We said to the angels: ‘Submit to Adam,’ and they (all) submitted. But Iblis (did not). He refused and was too proud; and he was of the disbelievers."
"And We said: ‘O Adam, dwell thou and thy wife in the garden, and eat therefrom plentifully wherever you will, but approach not this tree, lest you be of the wrongdoers.’"
"But Satan caused them both to slip by means of it and drove them out of (the state) in which they were. And We said: ‘Go forth; some of you are enemies of others, and for you there is an abode in the earth and a provision for a time."
"Then Adam learnt from his Lord certain words (of prayer). So He turned towards him with mercy. Surely, He is Oft-Returning (with compassion, and is) Merciful."
"We said: ‘Go forth, all of you, from here. And if there comes to you guidance from Me, then whoso shall follow My guidance, on them (shall come) no fear, nor shall they grieve.’"
"But they who will disbelieve and treat Our Signs as lies, these shall be the inmates of the Fire; therein shall they abide."
"O children of Israel! remember My favour which I bestowed upon you, and fulfil your covenant with Me, I will fulfil My covenant with you, and Me alone should you fear."
"And believe in what I have sent down which fulfils that which is with you, and be not the first to disbelieve therein, and barter not My Signs for a paltry price, and take protection in Me alone."
"And confound not truth with falsehood nor hide the truth, knowingly."
"And observe Prayer and pay the Zakat, and bow down with those who bow."
"Do you enjoin others to do what is good and forget your own selves, while you read the Book? Will you not then understand?"
"And seek help with patience and Prayer; and this indeed is hard except for the humble in spirit,"
"Who know for certain that they will meet their Lord, and that to Him will they return."
O children of Israel! remember My favour which I bestowed upon you and that I exalted you above the peoples.
"And fear the day when no soul shall serve as a substitute for another soul at all, nor shall intercession be accepted for it; nor shall ransom be taken from it; nor shall they be helped."
"And (remember the time) when We delivered you from Pharaoh’s people who afflicted you with grievous torment, slaying your sons and sparing your women; and in that there was a great trial for you from your Lord."
"And (remember the time) when We divided the sea for you and saved you and drowned Pharaoh’s people, while you looked on."
And (remember the time) when We made Moses a promise of forty nights; then you took the calf (for worship) in his absence and you were transgressors.
"Then We forgave you thereafter, that you might be grateful."
"And (remember the time) when We gave Moses the Book and the Discrimination, that you might be rightly guided."
"And (remember the time) when Moses said to his people: ‘O my people, you have indeed wronged yourselves by taking the calf (for worship); turn you therefore to your Maker, and kill your evil desires; that is the best for you with your Maker.’ Then He turned towards you with compassion. Surely, He is Oft-Returning (with compassion, and is) Merciful."
"And (remember) when you said: ‘O Moses, we will by no means believe thee until we see Allah face to face;’ then the thunderbolt overtook you, while you gazed."
"Then We raised you up after your death, that you might be grateful."
"And We caused the clouds to be a shade over you and sent down on you Manna and Salwa, (saying): ‘Eat of the good things We have provided for you.’ And they wronged Us not, but it was themselves that they wronged."
And (remember the time) when We said: “Enter this village and eat therefrom  —  wherever you will  —   plentifully; and enter the gate submissively and say: ‘(God)! forgive us our sins.’ We shall forgive you your sins and We shall give increase to those who do good.”
"The transgressors changed (it) for a word other than that which was said to them. So We sent down upon the transgressors a punishment from heaven, because they were disobedient."
"And (remember the time) when Moses prayed for water for his people, and We said: ‘Strike the rock with thy rod,’ and there gushed forth from it twelve springs, (so that) every tribe knew their drinking place. ‘Eat and drink of what Allah has provided, and commit not iniquity in the earth, creating disorder.’"
"And (remember the time) when you said: ‘O Moses, surely, we will not remain content with one (kind of) food; pray, then, to thy Lord for us that He bring forth for us of what the earth grows — of its herbs and its cucumbers and its wheat and its lentils and its onions.’ He said: ‘Would you take in exchange that which is inferior for that which is superior? Go down to some town, and there is for you what you ask.’ And they were smitten with abasement and destitution, and they incurred the wrath of Allah: that was because they rejected the Signs of Allah and would kill the Prophets unjustly; that was because they rebelled and transgressed."
"Surely, the Believers, and the Jews, and the Christians and the Sabians — whichever party (from among these truly) believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good deeds — shall have their reward with their Lord, and no fear (shall come) upon them, nor shall they grieve."
"And (remember the time) when We took a covenant from you and raised high above you the Mount, (saying): ‘Hold fast that which We have given you and bear in mind what is therein, that you may be saved.’"
"Then you turned back thereafter; and had it not been for Allah’s grace towards you and His mercy, you would surely have been of the losers."
"And surely, you have known (the end of) those amongst you, who transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath. So We said to them: ‘Be ye apes, despised.’"
"Thus We made it an example to those of its time and to those who came after it, and a lesson to those who fear God."
"And (remember) when Moses said to his people: ‘Allah commands you to slaughter a cow,’ they said: ‘Dost thou make a jest of us?’ He said: ‘I seek refuge with Allah from being one of the ignorant.’"
"They said: ‘Pray for us to thy Lord that He make plain to us what she is.’ He answered: ‘(God) says, it is a cow, neither old nor young, fullgrown, between the two; now do what you are commanded.’"
"They said: ‘Pray for us to thy Lord that He make plain to us what colour she is.’ He answered: ‘(God) says, it is a cow of a dun colour, pure and rich (in tone); delighting the beholders.’"
"They said: ‘Pray for us to thy Lord that He make plain to us what she is, for (all such) cows appear to us alike; and if Allah please, we shall indeed be guided.’"
"He answered: ‘(God) says, it is a cow not broken in to plough the earth or water the tilth; one without blemish; of one colour.’ They said: ‘Now hast thou brought the truth.’ Then they slaughtered her, though they would rather not do so."
And (remember the time) when you slew a person and differed among yourselves about it; and Allah would bring to light what you concealed.
Then We said: ‘Smite him (the murderer) for a part of (the offence against) him (the murdered person).’ Thus Allah gives life to the dead and shows you His Signs that you may understand.
"Then your hearts became hardened after that, till they were like stones or harder still; for of stones indeed there are some out of which gush forth streams, and of them there are some out of which flows water when they cleave asunder. And indeed, of them there are some that humble themselves for fear of Allah. And Allah is not unmindful of what you do."
"Do you expect that they will believe you when a party of them hear the word of Allah, then pervert it after they have understood it, and they know (the consequences thereof) ?"
"And when they meet those who believe, they say: ‘We believe,’ and when they meet one another in private, they say: ‘Do you inform them of what Allah has unfolded to you, that they may thereby argue with you before your Lord? Will you not then understand?’"
Do they not know that Allah knows what they conceal and what they disclose?
"And some of them are illiterate; they know not the Book but (their own) false notions, and they (do nothing) but conjecture."
"Woe, therefore, to those who write the Book with their own hands, and then say: ‘This is from Allah,’ that they may take for it a paltry price. Woe, then, to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for what they earn."
"And they say: ‘The Fire shall not touch us except for a (small) number of days.’ Say: ‘Have you taken a promise from Allah? Then, Allah will never break His promise. Or, do you say of Allah what you know not?’"
"Aye, whoso does evil and is encompassed by his sins — those are the inmates of the Fire; therein shall they abide."
But they who believe and do good works — those are the dwellers of Heaven; therein shall they abide.
"And (remember the time) when We took a covenant from the children of Israel: ‘You shall worship (nothing) but Allah and (show) kindness to parents and to kindred and orphans and the poor, and speak to men kindly and observe Prayer, and pay the Zakat;’ then you turned away in aversion, except a few of you."
And (remember the time) when We took a covenant from you: ‘You shall not shed your blood or turn your people out of your homes;’ then you confirmed (it); and you have been witness (to it).
"Yet you are the people who slay your own brethren and turn out a section of your people from their homes, backing up one another against them with sin and transgression. And if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, while their (very) expulsion was unlawful for you. Do you, then, believe in part of the Book and disbelieve in part? There is, therefore, no reward for such among you as do this, except disgrace in the present life; and on the Day of Judgment they shall be driven to a most severe chastisement; and surely, Allah is not unmindful of what you do."
"These are they who have preferred the present life to the Hereafter. Their punishment shall not therefore be lightened, nor shall they be helped (in any other way)."
"And verily, We gave Moses the Book and caused after him Messengers to follow in his footsteps; and to Jesus, son of Mary, We gave manifest Signs, and strengthened him with the Spirit of holiness. Will you then, every time a Messenger comes to you with what you yourselves desire not, behave arrogantly and treat some as liars and slay others?"
"They said: ‘Our hearts are wrapped in covers.’ Nay, Allah has cursed them for their disbelief. Little is that which they believe."
"And when there came to them a Book from Allah, fulfilling that which is with them — and before that they had prayed for victory over the disbelievers — yet when there came to them that which they knew, they rejected it. The curse of Allah be on the disbelievers."
"Evil is that for which they have sold their souls: that they should disbelieve in what Allah has revealed, grudging that Allah should send down His grace on whomsoever of His servants He pleases. So they incurred wrath upon wrath; and there is an humiliating chastisement for the disbelievers."
"And when it is said to them: ‘Believe in what Allah has sent down,’ they say: ‘We believe in what has been sent down to us;’ and they disbelieve in what (has been sent down) after that, yet it is the Truth, fulfilling that which is with them. Say: ‘Why, then, did you attempt to slay the Prophets of Allah before this, if you were believers?’"
"And Moses came to you with manifest Signs, then you took the calf (for worship) in his absence and you were transgressors."
"And (remember the time), when We took a covenant from you and raised high above you the Mount, (saying): ‘Hold firmly to what We have given you and hearken;’ they said: ‘We hear and we disobey;’ and their hearts were permeated with (the love of) the calf because of their disbelief. Say: ‘Evil is that which your faith enjoins on you, if you have any faith!’"
"Say: ‘If the abode of the Hereafter, with Allah, is solely for you to the exclusion of (all) other people, then wish for death, if you are truthful.’"
"But never shall they wish for it, because of what their own hands have sent on before (them); and Allah knows the wrongdoers well."
"And thou shalt surely find them of all people, the most covetous of life, even (more) than those who set up equals (with God). Every one of them wishes that he may be granted a life of a thousand years, but his being granted (such) life shall not keep him away from the punishment; and Allah sees all that they do."
"Say: ‘Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel — for he it is who has caused it to descend on thy heart by the command of Allah, which fulfils that which precedes it, and is a guidance and glad tidings to the believers — "
"‘Whoever is an enemy to Allah, and His angels, and His Messengers, and Gabriel, and Michael, then surely, Allah is an enemy to (such) disbelievers.’"
"And surely, We have sent down to thee manifest Signs, and no one disbelieves in them but the disobedient."
"What! every time they make a covenant, will a party among them throw it aside? Nay, most of them have no faith."
"And (now) when there has come to them a Messenger from Allah, fulfilling that which is with them, a party of the people to whom the Book was given have thrown the Book of Allah behind their backs, as if they knew (it) not."
"And they pursue (the course) which the rebellious (men) followed during the reign of Solomon. And Solomon did not disbelieve; but (it was) the rebellious ones (who) disbelieved, teaching people falsehood and deception. And (they pursue) what was revealed to the two angels in Babylon, Harut and Marut. But these two taught no one until they had said: ‘We are but a trial, do not therefore disbelieve.’ So men learnt from them that by which they made a difference between a man and his wife, but they harmed no one thereby, except by the command of Allah; (on the contrary), these people are learning that which would harm them and do them no good. And they have certainly known that he who trafficks therein has no share of good in the Hereafter; and surely, evil is that for which they have sold their souls; had they but known!"
"And if they had believed and acted righteously, better surely would have been the reward from Allah, had they but known!"
"O ye who believe! say not ‘Ra‘ina,’ but say, ‘Unzurna’ and hearken. And for the disbelievers is a painful punishment."
"They who disbelieve from among the People of the Book, or from among those who associate gods (with Allah), desire not that any good should be sent down to you from your Lord; but Allah chooses for His mercy whomsoever He pleases; and Allah is of exceeding bounty."
"Whatever Sign We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We bring one better than that or the like thereof. Dost thou not know that Allah has the power to do all that He wills?"
Dost thou not know that the kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah alone? And there is no protector or helper for you beside Allah.
Would you question the Messenger sent to you as Moses was questioned before this? And whoever takes disbelief in exchange for belief has undoubtedly gone astray from the right path.
"Many of the People of the Book wish out of (sheer) envy from their own selves that, after you have believed, they could turn you again into disbelievers after the truth has become manifest to them. But forgive and turn away (from them), till Allah brings about His decree. Surely, Allah has the power to do all that He wills."
"And observe Prayer and pay the Zakat; and whatever good you send on before you for yourselves, you shall find it with Allah; surely, Allah sees all that you do."
"And they say, ‘None shall ever enter Heaven unless he be a Jew or a Christian.’ These are their vain desires. Say, ‘Produce your proof, if you are truthful.’"
"Nay, whoever submits himself completely to Allah, and is the doer of good, shall have his reward with his Lord. No fear (shall come) upon such, neither shall they grieve."
"And the Jews say, ‘The Christians stand on nothing;’ and the Christians say, ‘The Jews stand on nothing;’ while they (both) read the (same) Book. Even thus said those who had no knowledge, like what they say. But Allah shall judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they disagree."
And who is more unjust than he who prohibits the name of Allah being glorified in Allah’s temples and seeks to ruin them? It was not proper for such men to enter therein except in fear. For them is disgrace in this world; and theirs shall be a great punishment in the next.
"To Allah belong the East and the West; so withersoever you turn, there will be the face of Allah. Surely, Allah is Bountiful, All- Knowing."
"And they say, ‘Allah has taken to (Himself) a son.’ Holy is He! Nay, everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him. To Him are all obedient."
"(He is) the Originator of the heavens and the earth. When He decrees a thing, He does only say to it, ‘Be!’ and it is."
"And those who have no knowledge say, ‘Why does not Allah speak to us, or a Sign come to us?’ Likewise said those before them similar to their saying. Their hearts are alike. We have certainly made the Signs plain for a people who firmly believe."
"We have sent thee with the Truth, as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner. And thou wilt not be questioned about the inmates of Hell."
"And the Jews will by no means be pleased with thee, nor the Christians, unless thou follow their creed. Say, ‘Surely, Allah’s guidance alone is the guidance.’ And if thou follow their evil desires after the knowledge that has come to thee, thou shalt have, from Allah, no friend nor helper."
"They to whom We have given the Book follow it as it ought to be followed; it is these that believe therein. And whoso believes not therein, these are they who are the losers."
"O ye children of Israel! remember My favour which I bestowed upon you, and that I exalted you above all peoples."
"And fear the day when no soul shall serve as a substitute for another soul at all, nor shall any ransom be accepted from it, nor any intercession avail it, nor shall they be helped."
"And (remember) when his Lord tried Abraham with certain commands which he fulfilled. He said, ‘I will make thee a Leader of men.’ (Abraham) asked, ‘And from among my offspring?’ He said, ‘My covenant does not embrace the transgressors.’"
"And (remember the time) when We made the House a resort for mankind and (a place of) security; and take ye the station of Abraham as a place of Prayer. And We commanded Abraham and Ishmael, (saying), ‘Purify My House for those who perform the circuit and those who remain (therein) for devotion and those who bow down and fall prostrate (in Prayer).’"
"And (remember) when Abraham said, ‘My Lord, make this a town of peace and provide with fruits such of its dwellers as believe in Allah and the Last Day,’ He said, ‘And on him too who believes not will I bestow benefits for a little while; then will I drive him to the punishment of the Fire, and an evil destination it is.’"
"And (remember the time) when Abraham and Ishmael raised the foundations of the House, (praying), ‘Our Lord, accept (this) from us; for Thou art All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
"‘Our Lord, make us submissive to Thee and (make) of our offspring a people submissive to Thee. And show us our ways of worship, and turn to us with mercy; for Thou art Oft-Returning (with compassion and) Merciful."
"‘And, our Lord, raise up among them a Messenger from among themselves, who may recite to them Thy Signs and teach them the Book and Wisdom and may purify them; surely, Thou art the Mighty, the Wise.’"
"And who will turn away from the religion of Abraham but he who is foolish of mind? Him did We choose in this world, and in the next he will surely be among the righteous."
"When his Lord said to him, ‘Submit,’ he said, ‘I have submitted to the Lord of the worlds.’"
"The same did Abraham enjoin upon his sons — and (so did) Jacob —  (saying): ‘O my sons, truly Allah has chosen this religion for you; so let not death overtake you except when you are in a state of submission.’"
"Were you present when death came to Jacob, when he said to his sons, ‘What will you worship after me?’ They answered, ‘We will worship thy God, the God of thy fathers, Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac, the One God; and to Him we submit ourselves.’"
"Those are a people that have passed away; for them is what they earned, and for you shall be what you earn; and you shall not be questioned as to what they did."
"And they say, ‘Be ye Jews or Christians that you may be rightly guided.’ Say: ‘Nay, (follow ye) the religion of Abraham who was ever inclined (to God); he was not of those who set up gods (with God).’"
"Say ye: ‘We believe in Allah and what has been revealed to us, and what was revealed to Abraham and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob and (his) children, and what was given to Moses and Jesus, and what was given to (all other) Prophets from their Lord. We make no difference between any of them; and to Him we submit ourselves.’"
"And if they believe as you have believed, then are they surely guided; but if they turn back, then they are only creating a schism, and Allah will surely suffice thee against them, for He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
"(Say, ‘We will adopt) the religion of Allah; and who is better than Allah in (teaching) religion, and Him alone do we worship.’"
"Say: ‘Do you dispute with us concerning Allah, while He is our Lord and your Lord? And for us are our works, and for you your works; and to Him alone we are sincerely devoted.’"
"Do you say that Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and (his) children were Jews or Christians? Say, ‘Do you know better or Allah?’ And who is more unjust than he who conceals the testimony that he has from Allah? And Allah is not unaware of what you do."
"Those are a people that have passed away; for them is what they earned, and for you shall be what you earn; and you shall not be questioned as to what they did."
The foolish among the people will say: ‘What has turned them away from their Qiblah which they followed?’ Say: ‘To Allah belong the East and the West. He guides whom He pleases to the right path.’
"And thus have We made you an exalted nation, that you may be guardians over men, and the Messenger (of God) may be a guardian over you. And We did not appoint the Qiblah which thou didst follow, except that We might know him who follows the Messenger (of God) from him who turns upon his heels. And this is indeed hard, except for those whom Allah has guided. And it does not behove Allah to let your faith go in vain; surely, Allah is Compassionate (and) Merciful to the people."
"Verily, We see thee turning thy face often to heaven; surely, then, will We make thee turn to the Qiblah which thou likest. So, turn thy face towards the Sacred Mosque; and wherever you be, turn your faces towards it. And they to whom the Book has been given know that this is the truth from their Lord; and Allah is not unmindful of what they do."
"And even if thou shouldst bring every Sign to those who have been given the Book, they would never follow thy Qiblah; nor wouldst thou follow their Qiblah; nor would some of them follow the Qiblah of others. And if thou shouldst follow their desires after the knowledge that has come to thee, then thou shalt surely be of the transgressors."
"Those to whom We have given the Book recognize it even as they recognize their sons, but surely some of them conceal the truth knowingly."
(It is) the truth from thy Lord; be not therefore of those who doubt.
"And every one has a goal which dominates him; vie, then, with one another in good works. Wherever you be, Allah will bring you all together. Surely, Allah has the power to do all that He wills."
"And from wheresoever thou comest forth, turn thy face towards the Sacred Mosque; for that is indeed the truth from thy Lord. And Allah is not unmindful of what you do."
"And from wheresoever thou comest forth, turn thy face towards the Sacred Mosque; and wherever you be, turn your faces towards it that people may have no argument against you, except those who are unjust — so fear them not, but fear Me — and that I may perfect My favour upon you; and that you may be rightly guided."
"Even as We have sent to you a Messenger from among yourselves who recites Our Signs to you, and purifies you, and teaches you the Book and Wisdom, and teaches you that which you did not know."
"Therefore remember Me, and I will remember you; and be thankful to Me and do not be ungrateful to Me."
"O ye who believe! seek help with patience and Prayer; surely, Allah is with the steadfast."
"And say not of those who are killed in the cause of Allah that they are dead; nay, they are living; only you perceive not."
"And We will try you with something of fear and hunger, and loss of wealth and lives, and fruits; but give glad tidings to the patient,"
"Who, when a misfortune overtakes them, say, ‘Surely, to Allah we belong and to Him shall we return.’"
"It is these on whom are blessings from their Lord and mercy, and it is these who are rightly guided."
"Surely, Al-Safa and Al-Marwah are among the Signs of Allah. It is, therefore, no sin for him who is on pilgrimage to the House, or performs ‘Umrah, to go round the two. And whoso does good beyond what is obligatory, surely then, Allah is Appreciating, All-Knowing."
"Those who conceal what We have sent down of Signs and guidance after We have made it clear for the people in the Book, it is these whom Allah curses; and (so) curse them those who curse."
"But they who repent and amend and openly declare (the truth), it is these to whom I turn with forgiveness, and I am Oft-Returning (with compassion and) Merciful."
"Those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers, on them shall be the curse of Allah and of angels and of men all together."
"They shall remain under it. The punishment shall not be lightened for them, nor shall they be granted respite."
"And your God is One God; there is no God but He, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and in the alternation of night and day, and in the ships which sail in the sea with that which profits men, and in the water which Allah sends down from the sky and quickens therewith the earth after its death and scatters therein all kinds of beasts, and in the change of the winds, and the clouds pressed into service between the heaven and the earth — are indeed Signs for the people who understand."
"And there are some among men who take for themselves objects of worship other than Allah, loving them as they should love Allah. But those who believe are stronger in (their) love for Allah and if those who transgress could (now) see (the time) when they shall see the punishment, (they would realize) that all power belongs to Allah and that Allah is severe in punishing."
"(Aye, they would certainly realize if they could see the time) when those who were followed shall disown their followers and shall see the punishment, and all their ties shall be cut asunder."
"And those who followed shall say: ‘If we could only return, we would disown them as they have disowned us.’ Thus will Allah show them their works as anguish for them, and they shall not get out of the Fire."
"O ye men! eat of what is lawful (and) good in the earth; and follow not the footsteps of Satan; surely, he is to you an open enemy."
"He only enjoins upon you what is evil and what is foul, and that you say of Allah what you do not know."
"And when it is said to them, ‘Follow that which Allah has sent down,’ they say: ‘Nay, we will follow that wherein we found our fathers.’ What! even if their fathers had no sense at all and no guidance?"
"And the case of those who disbelieve is like the case of one who shouts to that which hears nothing but a call and a cry. (They are) deaf, dumb, (and) blind — so they do not understand."
"O ye who believe! eat of the good things We have provided for you, and render thanks to Allah, if it is He Whom you worship."
"He has made unlawful to you only that which dies of itself, and blood and the flesh of swine, and that on which the name of any other than Allah has been invoked. But he who is driven by necessity, being neither disobedient nor exceeding the limit, it shall be no sin for him. Surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"Those who conceal that which Allah has sent down of the Book and take in exchange for that a paltry price, they fill their bellies with nothing but fire. Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them. And for them is a grievous punishment."
It is they who have taken error in exchange for guidance and punishment for forgiveness. How great is their endurance of the Fire!
"That is because Allah has sent down the Book with the truth; and surely, they who disagree concerning the Book are gone far in enmity."
"It is not righteousness that you turn your faces to the East or the West, but (truly) righteous is he who believes in Allah and the Last Day and the angels and the Book and the Prophets, and spends his money for love of Him, on the kindred and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer and those who ask (for charity), and for (ransoming) the captives; and who observes Prayer and pays the Zakat; and those who fulfil their promise when they have made one, and the patient in poverty and afflictions and (the steadfast) in time of war; it is these who have proved truthful and it is these who are the God-fearing."
"O ye who believe! (equitable) retaliation in (the matter of) the slain is prescribed for you: the free man for the free man, and the slave for the slave, and the female for the female. But if one is granted any remission by one’s brother, then (pursuing the matter for the realization of the blood money) shall be done with fairness and (the murderer) shall pay him the blood money in a handsome manner. This is an alleviation from your Lord and a mercy. And whoso transgresses thereafter, for him there shall be a grievous punishment."
"And there is life for you in (the law) of retaliation, O men of understanding, that you may enjoy security."
"It is prescribed for you, when death comes to any one of you, if he leave much wealth, (that he make) a will to parents and near relatives to act with fairness; (it is) an obligation on those who fear God."
"And he who alters it after he has heard it, the sin thereof shall surely lie on those who alter it. Surely, Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
"But whoso apprehends from a testator a partiality or a wrong, and makes peace between them (the parties affected), it shall be no sin for him. Surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"O ye who believe! fasting is prescribed for you, as it was prescribed for those before you, so that you may become righteous."
"(The prescribed fasting is) for a fixed number of days, but whoso among you is sick or is on a journey (shall fast) the same number of other days; and for those who are able to fast (only) with great difficulty is an expiation — the feeding of a poor man. And whoso performs a good work with willing obedience, it is better for him. And fasting is good for you, if you only knew."
"The month of Ramadan is that in which the Qur’an was sent down as a guidance for mankind with clear proofs of guidance and discrimination. Therefore, whosoever of you is present (at home) in this month, let him fast therein. But whoso is sick or is on a journey, (shall fast) the same number of other days. Allah desires (to give) you facility and He desires not hardship for you, and that you may complete the number, and that you may exalt Allah for His having guided you and that you may be grateful."
"And when My servants ask thee about Me, say: ‘I am near. I answer the prayer of the supplicant when he prays to Me. So they should hearken to Me and believe in Me, that they may follow the right way.’"
"It is made lawful for you to go in unto your wives on the night of the fast. They are a garment for you, and you are a garment for them. Allah knows that you have been acting unjustly to yourselves, wherefore He has turned to you with mercy and afforded you relief. So you may now go in unto them and seek what Allah has ordained for you; and eat and drink until the white thread becomes distinct to you from the black thread of the dawn. Then complete the fast till nightfall and do not go in unto them while you remain in the mosques for devotion. These are the limits (fixed) by Allah, so approach them not. Thus does Allah make His commandments clear to men that they may become secure against evil."
"And do not devour your wealth among yourselves through falsehood, and offer it not (as bribe) to the authorities that you may knowingly devour a part of the wealth of (other) people with injustice."
"They ask thee about the new moons. Say, ‘They are means for measuring time for (the general good of) mankind and for the Pilgrimage.’ And it is not righteousness that you come into houses by the backs thereof; but (truly) righteous is he who fears God. And you should come into houses by the doors thereof; and fear Allah that you may prosper."
"And fight in the cause of Allah against those who fight against you, but do not transgress. Surely, Allah loves not the transgressors."
"And kill them wherever you meet them and drive them out from where they have driven you out; for persecution is worse than killing. And fight them not (in, and) near, the Sacred Mosque until they fight you therein. But if they fight you, then fight them: such is the requital for the disbelievers."
"But if they desist, then surely Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"And fight them until there is no persecution, and religion is (freely professed) for Allah. But if they desist, then (remember) that no hostility is allowed except against the aggressors."
"The (violation of a) Sacred Month (should be retaliated) in the Sacred Month; and for (all) sacred things there is (the law of) retaliation. So, whoso transgresses against you, punish him for his transgression to the extent to which he has transgressed against you. And fear Allah and know that Allah is with those who fear Him."
"And spend for the cause of Allah, and cast not yourselves into ruin with your own hands, and do good; surely, Allah loves those who do good."
"And complete the Hajj and the ‘Umrah for the sake of Allah: but if you are kept back, then (make) whatever offering is easily available; and do not shave your heads until the offering reaches its destination. And whoever among you is sick or has an ailment of the head, (should make) an expiation either by fasting or almsgiving or a sacrifice. But when you are safe, then he, who would avail himself of the ‘Umrah together with the Hajj, (should make) whatever offering is easily obtainable. But such (of you) as cannot find (an offering) should fast three days during the Pilgrimage, and seven when you return home; these are ten complete. This is for him whose family does not reside near the Sacred Mosque. And fear Allah and know that Allah is severe in punishing."
"The months of the Hajj are well known; so whoever determines to perform the Pilgrimage in these months, (should remember that) there is (to be) no foul talk, nor any transgression, nor any quarrelling during the Pilgrimage. And whatever good you do, Allah knows it. And furnish yourselves with (necessary) provisions, and surely, the best provision is righteousness. And fear Me (alone), O men of understanding."
"It is no sin for you that you seek the bounty of your Lord. But when you pour forth from ‘Arafat, remember Allah at Mash‘ar al- Haram; and remember Him as He has guided you, although, before this, you were of those gone astray."
"Then pour forth from where the people pour forth, and seek forgiveness from Allah; surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"And when you have performed the acts of worship prescribed for you, celebrate the praises of Allah as you celebrated the praises of your fathers, or even more than that. And of men there are some who say, ‘Our Lord, grant us (good things) in this world;’ and such a one shall have no share in the Hereafter."
"And of them there are some who say: ‘Our Lord, grant us good in this world as well as good in the world to come, and protect us from the torment of the Fire.’"
For these there shall be a (goodly) share because of what they have earned. And Allah is swift at reckoning.
"And remember Allah during the appointed number of days; but whoso hastens (to leave) in two days, it shall be no sin for him; and whoso stays behind, it shall be no sin for him. (This is) for him who fears God. And fear Allah and know that you shall be brought together before Him."
"And of men there is he whose talk on this life would please thee, and he would call Allah to witness as to that which is in his heart, and yet he is the most contentious of quarrellers."
"And when he is in authority, he runs about in the land to create disorder in it and destroy the crops and the progeny (of man); and Allah loves not disorder."
"And when it is said to him, ‘Fear Allah,’ pride incites him to (further) sin. So Hell shall be his sufficient reward; and surely, it is an evil place of rest."
And of men there is he who would sell himself to seek the pleasure of Allah; and Allah is Compassionate to (His) servants.
"O ye who believe! come into submission wholly and follow not the footsteps of Satan; surely, he is your open enemy."
"But if you slip after the clear Signs that have come to you, then know that Allah is Mighty, Wise."
"Are they waiting for anything but that Allah should come to them in the coverings of the clouds with angels, and the matter be decided? And to Allah do all things return."
"Ask of the children of Israel how many clear Signs We gave them. But whoso changes the gift of Allah after it has come to him, surely, then, Allah is severe in punishing."
The life of this world is made (to appear) attractive to those who disbelieve; and they scoff at those who believe. But those who fear (God) shall be above them on the Day of Resurrection; and Allah bestows (His gifts) on whomsoever He pleases without reckoning.
"Mankind were one community, (then they differed among themselves), so Allah raised Prophets as bearers of good tidings and as warners, and sent down with them the Book containing the truth that He might judge between the people wherein they differed. (But now they began to differ about the Book), and none differed about it except those to whom it was given, after clear Signs had come to them, out of envy towards one another. Now has Allah, by His command, guided the believers to the truth in regard to which they (the unbelievers) differed; and Allah guides whomsoever He pleases to the right path."
"Do you think that you will enter Heaven while there has not come over you the condition of those who passed away before you? Poverty and afflictions befell them, and they were violently shaken until the Messenger and those who believed along with him said: ‘When (will come) the help of Allah?’ Yea, surely the help of Allah is nigh."
"They ask thee what they shall spend. Say: ‘Whatever of good and abundant wealth you spend should be for parents and near relatives and orphans and the needy and the wayfarer. And whatever good you do, surely Allah knows it well.’"
"Fighting is ordained for you, though it is repugnant to you; but it may be that you dislike a thing while it is good for you, and it may be that you like a thing while it is bad for you. Allah knows (all things), and you know not."
"They ask thee about fighting in the Sacred Month. Say: ‘Fighting therein is (a) great (transgression), but to hinder men from the way of Allah, and to be ungrateful to Him and (to hinder men from) the Sacred Mosque, and to turn out its people therefrom, is (a) greater (sin) with Allah; and persecution is worse than killing.’ And they will not cease fighting you until they turn you back from your faith, if they can. And whoso from among you turns back from his faith and dies while he is a disbeliever, it is they whose works shall be vain in this world and the next. These are the inmates of the Fire and therein shall they abide."
"Those who believe and those who emigrate and strive hard in the cause of Allah, it is these who hope for Allah’s mercy; and Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
They ask thee concerning wine and the game of hazard. Say: ‘In both there is great sin and also (some) advantages for men; but their sin is greater than their advantage.’ And they ask thee what they should spend. Say: ‘What you can spare.’ Thus does Allah make His commandments clear to you that you may reflect.
"Upon this world and the next. And they ask thee concerning the orphans. Say: ‘Promotion of their welfare is (an act of) great goodness. And if you intermix with them, they are your brethren. And Allah knows the mischief-maker from the reformer. And if Allah had so willed, He would have put you to hardship. Surely, Allah is Mighty, Wise.’"
"And marry not idolatrous women until they believe; even a believing bond-woman is better than an idolatress, although she may (highly) please you. And give not (believing women) in marriage to idolaters until they believe; (even) a believing slave is better than an idolater, although he may (highly) please you. These call to the Fire, but Allah calls to Heaven and to forgiveness by His command. And He makes His Signs clear to the people that they may remember."
"And they ask thee concerning menstruation. Say: ‘It is a harmful thing, so keep away from women during menstruation, and go not in unto them until they are clean. But when they have cleansed themselves, go in unto them as Allah has commanded you. Allah loves those who turn to Him and loves those who keep themselves clean.’"
Your wives are a tilth for you; so approach your tilth when and how you like and send ahead (some good) for yourselves; and fear Allah and know that you shall meet Him; and give good tidings to those who obey.
"And make not Allah a target for your oaths that you may (thereby) abstain from doing good and acting righteously and making peace between men. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
"Allah will not call you to account for such of your oaths as are vain, but He will call you to account for what your hearts have earned. And Allah is Most Forgiving, Forbearing."
"For those who vow (abstinence) from their wives, the (maximum) period of waiting is four months; then if they go back from the vow, surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"And if they decide upon divorce, then surely, Allah is All- Hearing, All-Knowing."
"And the divorced women shall wait concerning themselves for three courses; and it is not lawful for them that they conceal what Allah has created in their wombs, if they believe in Allah and the Last Day; and their husbands have the greater right to take them back during that period, provided they desire reconciliation. And they (the women) have rights similar to those (of men) over them in equity; but men have a rank above them. And Allah is Mighty, Wise."
"Such divorce may be (pronounced) twice; then, either retain (them) in a becoming manner or send (them) away with kindness. And it is not lawful for you that you take anything of what you have given them (your wives) unless both fear that they cannot observe the limits (prescribed) by Allah. But, if you fear that they cannot observe the limits (prescribed) by Allah, then it shall be no sin for either of them in what she gives to get her freedom. These are the limits (prescribed) by Allah, so transgress them not; and whoso transgresses the limits (prescribed) by Allah, it is they that are the wrongdoers."
"And if he divorce her (the third time), then she is not lawful for him thereafter, until she marries another husband; and, if he (also) divorce her, then it shall be no sin for them to return to each other, provided they are sure that they would be able to observe the limits (prescribed) by Allah. And these are the limits (prescribed) by Allah which He makes clear to the people who have knowledge."
"And when you divorce your wives and they approach the end of their (appointed) period, then either retain them in a becoming manner; or send them away in a becoming manner; but retain them not wrongfully so that you may transgress. And whoso does that, surely wrongs his own soul. And do not make a jest of the commandments of Allah, and remember the favour of Allah upon you and the Book and the Wisdom which He has sent down to you, whereby He exhorts you. And fear Allah and know that Allah knows all things well."
"And when you divorce women and they reach the end of their period, prevent them not from marrying their husbands, if they agree between themselves in a decent manner. This is an admonition for him among you who believes in Allah and the Last Day. It is more blessed for you and purer; and Allah knows but you do not know."
"And mothers shall give suck to their children for two whole years; (this is) for those who desire to complete the suckling. And the man to whom the child belongs shall be responsible for their (the mothers’) food and clothing according to usage. No soul is burdened beyond its capacity. The mother shall not make (the father) suffer on account of her child, nor shall he to whom the child belongs make (the mother) suffer on account of his child, and the same is incumbent on the heir. If they both decide upon weaning (the child) by mutual consent and consultation, there is no blame on them. And if you desire to engage a wetnurse for your children, there shall be no blame on you, provided you pay what you have agreed to pay, in a fair manner. And fear Allah and know that Allah sees what you do."
"And those of you who die and leave wives behind, these (wives) shall wait concerning themselves four months and ten (days). And when they have reached the end of their period, no sin shall lie on you in anything that they do with regard to themselves according to what is fair. And Allah is aware of what you do."
"And there shall be no blame on you in throwing out a hint regarding a proposal of marriage to (these) women or in keeping (the desire) hidden in your minds. Allah knows that you will think of them (in this connection). But make not a contract with them in secret, except that you say a fair word. And resolve not on the marriage tie until the prescribed period reaches its end. And know that Allah knows what is in your minds; so beware of it. And know that Allah is Most Forgiving, Forbearing."
"It shall be no sin for you if you divorce women while you have not touched them, nor settled for them a dowry. But provide for them — the rich man according to his means and the poor man according to his means  — a provision in a becoming manner, an obligation upon the virtuous."
"And if you divorce them before you have touched them, but have settled for them a dowry, then half of what you have settled (shall be due from you), unless they remit, or he, in whose hand is the tie of marriage, should remit. And that you should remit is nearer to righteousness. And do not forget to do good to one another. Surely, Allah sees what you do."
"Watch over Prayers, and the middle Prayer, and stand before Allah submissively."
"If you are in (a state of) fear, then (say your Prayer) on foot or riding; but when you are safe, remember Allah as He has taught you that which you did not know."
"And those of you who die and leave behind wives shall bequeath to their wives provision for a year without (their) being turned out. But if they (themselves) go out, there shall be no blame upon you in regard to any proper thing which they do concerning themselves. And Allah is Mighty, Wise."
And for the divorced women (also) there should be a provision according to what is fair — an obligation on the God-fearing.
Thus does Allah make His commandments clear to you that you may understand.
"Dost thou not know of those who went forth from their homes, and they were thousands, fearing death? And Allah said to them: ‘Die;’ then He brought them to life. Surely, Allah is Munificent to men, but most men are not grateful."
"And fight in the cause of Allah and know that Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
"Who is it that will lend Allah a goodly loan that He may multiply it for him manifold? And Allah receives and enlarges, and to Him shall you be made to return."
"Hast thou not heard of the chiefs of the children of Israel after Moses, when they said to a Prophet of theirs: ‘Appoint for us a king that we may fight in the cause of Allah?’ He said: ‘Is it not likely that you will not fight, if fighting is prescribed for you?’ They said: ‘What reason have we to abstain from fighting in the cause of Allah when we have been driven forth from our homes and our sons?’ But when fighting was ordained for them, they turned back except a small number of them. And Allah knows the transgressors well."
"And their Prophet said to them: ‘Allah has appointed for you Talut as a king.’ They said: ‘How can he have sovereignty over us while we are better entitled to sovereignty than he, and he is not given abundance of wealth?’ He said: ‘Surely, Allah has chosen him above you and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and body.’ And Allah gives sovereignty to whom He pleases and Allah is Bountiful, All-Knowing."
"And their Prophet said to them: ‘The sign of his sovereignty is that there shall be given you a heart wherein there will be tranquillity from your Lord and a legacy (of good) left by the family of Moses and the family of Aaron — the angels bearing it. Surely, in this there is a Sign for you if you are believers.’"
"And when Talut set out with the forces, he said: ‘Surely, Allah will try you with a river. So he who drinks therefrom is not of me; and he who tastes it not is assuredly of me, except him who takes a handful of water with his hand.’ But they drank of it, except a few of them. And when they crossed it — he and those who believed along with him  — they said: ‘We have no power today against Jalut and his forces.’ But those who knew for certain that they would (one day) meet Allah said: ‘How many a small party has triumphed over a large party by Allah’s command! And Allah is with the steadfast.’"
"And when they issued forth to (encounter) Jalut and his forces, they said: ‘O our Lord, pour forth steadfastness upon us, and make our steps firm, and help us against the disbelieving people.’"
"So they routed them by the command of Allah; and David slew Jalut, and Allah gave him sovereignty and wisdom, and taught him of what He pleased. And had it not been for Allah’s repelling men, some of them by the others, the earth would have become filled with disorder. But Allah is Munificent to (all) peoples."
"These are the Signs of Allah; We recite them unto thee with truth. Surely, thou art (one) of the Messengers."
"These Messengers have We exalted, some of them above others: among them there are those to whom Allah spoke; and some of them He exalted by degrees of rank. And We gave Jesus, son of Mary, clear proofs and strengthened him with the Spirit of holiness. And if Allah had (so) willed, those (that came) after them would not have fought with one another after clear Signs had come to them; but they did disagree. Of them were some who believed, and of them were some who disbelieved. And if Allah had (so) willed, they would not have fought with one another; but Allah does what He desires."
"O ye who believe! spend out of what We have bestowed on you before the day comes wherein there shall be no buying and selling, nor friendship, nor intercession; and it is those who disbelieve that do wrong (to themselves)."
"Allah — there is no God but He, the Living, the Self-Subsisting and All-Sustaining. Slumber seizes Him not, nor sleep. To Him belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth. Who is he that will intercede with Him except by His permission? He knows what is before them and what is behind them; and they encompass nothing of His knowledge except what He pleases. His knowledge extends over the heavens and the earth; and the care of them burdens Him not; and He is the High, the Great."
"There should be no compulsion in religion. Surely, right has become distinct from wrong; so whosoever refuses to be led by those who transgress, and believes in Allah, has surely grasped a strong handle which knows no breaking. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
"Allah is the friend of those who believe: He brings them out of every (kind of) darkness into light. And those who disbelieve, their friends are the transgressors who bring them out of light into every (kind of) darkness. These are the inmates of the Fire; therein shall they abide."
"Hast thou not heard of him who disputed with Abraham about his Lord, because Allah had given him kingdom? When Abraham said, ‘My Lord is He Who gives life and causes death,’ he said, ‘I (also) give life and cause death.’ Abraham said, ‘Well, Allah brings the sun from the East; bring it thou from the West.’ Thereupon the infidel was dumbfounded. And Allah guides not the unjust people."
"Or like him who passed by a town which had fallen down upon its roofs, (and) exclaimed, ‘When will Allah restore it to life after its destruction?’ Then Allah caused him to die for a hundred years; then He raised him, and said: ‘How long hast thou remained (in this state)?’ He answered, ‘I have remained a day or part of a day.’ He said: ‘Nay, thou hast remained (in this state) for a hundred years. Now look at thy food and thy drink; they have not rotted. And look at thy ass. And (We have done this) that We may make thee a Sign unto men. And look at the bones, how We set them and then clothe them with flesh.’ And when this became clear to him, he said, ‘I know that Allah has the power to do all that He wills.’"
"And (remember) when Abraham said, ‘My Lord, show me how Thou givest life to the dead.’ He said, ‘Hast thou not believed?’ He said, ‘Yes, but (I ask this) that my heart may be at rest.’ He answered, ‘Take four birds and make them attached to thyself. Then put each of them on a hill; then call them; they will come to thee in haste. And know that Allah is Mighty, Wise.’"
"The similitude of those who spend their wealth for the cause of Allah is like the similitude of a grain of corn which grows seven ears, in each ear a hundred grains. And Allah multiplies (it) further for whomsoever He pleases; and Allah is Bountiful, All-Knowing."
"They who spend their wealth for the cause of Allah, then follow not up what they have spent with taunt or injury, for them is their reward with their Lord, and they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve."
"A kind word and forgiveness are better than charity followed by injury. And Allah is Self-Sufficient, Forbearing."
"O ye who believe! render not vain your alms by taunt and injury, like him who spends his wealth to be seen of men, and he believes not in Allah and the Last Day. His case is like the case of a smooth rock (covered) with earth, on which heavy rain falls, leaving it bare, smooth and hard. They shall not secure aught of what they earn. And Allah guides not the disbelieving people."
"And the case of those who spend their wealth to seek the pleasure of Allah and to strengthen their souls is like the case of a garden on elevated ground. Heavy rain falls on it so that it brings forth its fruit twofold. And if heavy rain does not fall on it, then light rain (suffices). And Allah sees what you do."
"Does any of you desire that there should be for him a garden of palm trees and vines with streams flowing beneath it, and with all kinds of fruit for him therein —  while old age has stricken him and he has weak offspring —  and that a fiery whirlwind should smite it and it be (all) burnt? Thus does Allah make His Signs clear to you that you may ponder."
"O ye who believe! spend of the good things that you have earned, and of what We produce for you from the earth; and seek not what is bad to spend out of it when you would not take it yourselves except that you connive at it. And know that Allah is Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy."
"Satan threatens you with poverty and enjoins upon you what is foul, whereas Allah promises you forgiveness from Himself and bounty. And Allah is Bountiful, All- Knowing."
"He grants wisdom to whom He pleases, and whoever is granted wisdom has indeed been granted abundant good; and none would be reminded except those endowed with understanding."
"And whatsoever you spend or whatsoever vow you vow, Allah surely knows it; and for the wrongdoers there shall be no helpers."
"If you give alms openly, it is well (and good); but if you conceal them and give them to the poor, it is better for you; and He will remove from you (many) of your sins. And Allah is aware of what you do."
"It is not thy responsibility to make them follow the right path; but Allah guides whomsoever He pleases. And whatever of wealth you spend, it is for yourselves, while you spend not but to seek the favour of Allah. And whatever of wealth you spend, it shall be paid back to you in full and you shall not be wronged."
"(These alms are) for the poor who are detained in the cause of Allah and are unable to move about in the land. The ignorant man thinks them to be free from want because of (their) abstaining (from begging). Thou shalt know them by their appearance; they do not beg of men with importunity. And whatever of wealth you spend, surely, Allah has perfect knowledge thereof."
"Those who spend their wealth by night and day, secretly and openly, have their reward with their Lord; on them (shall come) no fear, nor shall they grieve."
"Those who devour interest do not rise except as rises one whom Satan has smitten with insanity. That is because they say: ‘Trade (also) is like interest;’ whereas Allah has made trade lawful and made interest unlawful. So he to whom an admonition comes from his Lord and he desists, then will that (which he received) in the past be his; and his affair is with Allah. And those who revert (to it), they are the inmates of the Fire; therein shall they abide."
Allah will abolish interest and will cause charity to increase. And Allah loves not anyone who is a confirmed disbeliever and an archsinner.
"Surely, those who believe and do good deeds, and observe Prayer and pay the Zakat, shall have their reward from their Lord, and no fear (shall come) on them, nor shall they grieve."
"O ye who believe! fear Allah and relinquish what remains of interest, if you are believers."
"But if you do (it) not, then beware of war from Allah and His Messenger; and if you repent, then you shall have your original sums; (thus) you shall not wrong, nor shall you be wronged."
"And if any (debtor) be in straitened circumstances, then (grant him) respite till a time of ease. And that you remit it as charity shall be better for you, if only you knew."
And fear the day when you shall be made to return to Allah; then shall every soul be paid in full what it has earned; and they shall not be wronged.
"O ye who believe! when you borrow one from another for a fixed period, then write it down. And let a scribe write (it) in your presence faithfully; and no scribe should refuse to write, because Allah has taught him, so let him write and let him who incurs the liability dictate; and he should fear Allah, his Lord, and not diminish anything therefrom. But if the person incurring the liability be of low understanding or be weak or be unable himself to dictate, then let someone who can watch his interest dictate with justice. And call two witnesses from among your men; and if two men be not (available), then a man and two women, of such as you like as witnesses, so that if either of two (women) should err (in memory), then one may remind the other. And the witnesses should not refuse when they are called. And do not feel weary of writing it down, whether it be small or large, along with its appointed time (of payment). This is more equitable in the sight of Allah and makes testimony surer and is more likely to keep you away from doubts; (therefore omit not to write) except that it be ready merchandise which you give or take from hand to hand, in which case it shall be no sin for you that you write it not. And have witnesses when you sell one to another; and let no harm be done to the scribe or the witness. And if you do (that), then certainly it shall be disobedience on your part. And fear Allah. And Allah grants you knowledge and Allah knows all things well."
"And if you be on a journey, and you find not a scribe, then let there be a pledge with possession. And if one of you entrusts another with something, then let him who is entrusted surrender his trust and let him fear Allah, his Lord. And conceal not testimony; and whoever conceals it, his heart is certainly sinful. And Allah is well aware of what you do."
"To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth; and whether you disclose what is in your minds or keep it hidden, Allah will call you to account for it; then will He forgive whomsoever He pleases and punish whomsoever He pleases; and Allah has the power to do all that He wills."
"This Messenger (of Ours) believes in that which has been revealed to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers: all (of them) believe in Allah, and in His angels, and in His Books, and in His Messengers, (saying), ‘We make no distinction between any of His Messengers;’ and they say, ‘We hear, and we obey. (We implore) Thy forgiveness, O our Lord, and to Thee is the returning.’"
"Allah burdens not any soul beyond its capacity. It shall have (the reward) it earns, and it shall get (the punishment) it incurs. Our Lord, do not punish us, if we forget or fall into error; and our Lord, lay not on us a responsibility as Thou didst lay upon those before us. Our Lord, burden us not with what we have not the strength to bear; and efface our (sins), and grant us forgiveness and have mercy on us; Thou art our Master; so help us Thou against the disbelieving people."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
Alif Lam Mim.
"Allah is He beside Whom there is no God, the Living, the Self-Subsisting and All-Sustaining."
He has sent down to thee the Book containing the truth (and) fulfilling that which precedes it; and He sent down the Torah and the Gospel
"Before (this), as a guidance to the people; and He has sent down the Discrimination. Surely, those who deny the Signs of Allah shall have a severe punishment. And Allah is Mighty, Possessor of the power to requite."
"Surely, nothing in the earth or in the heaven is hidden from Allah."
"He it is Who fashions you in the wombs as He wills; there is no God but He, the Mighty, the Wise."
"He it is Who has sent down to thee the Book; in it there are verses that are decisive in meaning — they are the basis of the Book — and there are others that are susceptible of different interpretations. But those in whose hearts is perversity pursue such thereof as are susceptible of different interpretations, seeking discord and seeking (wrong) interpretation of it. And none knows its (right) interpretation except Allah and those who are firmly grounded in knowledge; they say, ‘We believe in it; the whole is from our Lord.’ —  And none heed except those gifted with understanding. — "
"‘Our Lord, let not our hearts become perverse after Thou hast guided us; and bestow on us mercy from Thyself; surely, Thou alone art the Bestower."
"‘Our Lord, Thou wilt certainly assemble mankind together on the Day about which there is no doubt; surely, Allah breaks not (His) promise.’"
Those who disbelieve — their possessions and their children shall not avail them at all against Allah; and it is they that are the fuel of the Fire.
"(Their case) is like the case of the people of Pharaoh and those before them; they rejected Our Signs; so Allah punished them for their sins, and Allah is severe in punishing."
"Say to those who disbelieve, ‘You shall be overcome and gathered unto Hell; and an evil place of rest it is.’"
"Certainly there was for you a Sign in the two armies that encountered each other, one army fighting in the cause of Allah and the other disbelieving, whom they saw to be twice as many as themselves, actually with (their) eyes. (Thus) Allah strengthens with His aid whomsoever He pleases. In that surely is a lesson for those who have eyes."
"Beautified for men is the love of desired things — women and children, and stored-up heaps of gold and silver, and pastured horses and cattle and crops. That is the provision of the present life; but it is Allah with Whom is an excellent home."
"Say, ‘Shall I inform you of something better than that?’ For those who fear God, there are Gardens with their Lord, beneath which rivers flow; therein shall they abide; and pure spouses and Allah’s pleasure. And Allah is Mindful of His servants,"
"Those who say, ‘Our Lord, we do believe; forgive us, therefore, our sins and save us from the punishment of the Fire;’"
"The steadfast, and the truthful, and the humble, and those who spend in the way of God, and those who seek forgiveness in the latter part of the night."
"Allah bears witness that there is no God but He — and (also do) the angels and those possessed of knowledge — Maintainer of justice; there is no God but He, the Mighty, the Wise."
"Surely, the (true) religion with Allah is Islam (complete submission). And those who were given the Book did not disagree but after knowledge had come to them, out of mutual envy. And whoso denies the Signs of Allah, then surely, Allah is quick at reckoning."
"But if they dispute with thee, say, ‘I have submitted myself to Allah, and (also) those who follow me.’ And say to those who have been given the Book and to the unlearned, ‘Have you submitted?’ If they submit, then they will surely be guided; but if they turn back, then thy duty is only to convey the message. And Allah is Watchful of (His) servants."
"Surely, those who deny the Signs of Allah and seek to kill the Prophets unjustly, and seek to kill such men as enjoin equity —  announce to them a painful punishment."
"Those are they whose deeds shall come to naught in this world and in the next, and they shall have no helpers."
"Dost thou not know of those who have been given (their) portion of the Book? They are called to the Book of Allah that it may judge between them, but a party of them turn away in aversion."
"That is because they say, ‘The Fire shall not touch us, except for a limited number of days.’ And what they used to forge has deceived them regarding their religion."
"How (will they fare) when We will gather them together on the Day about which there is no doubt; and when every soul shall be paid in full what it has earned, and they shall not be wronged?"
"Say, ‘O Allah, Lord of sovereignty, Thou givest sovereignty to whomsoever Thou pleasest; and Thou takest away sovereignty from whomsoever Thou pleasest. Thou exaltest whomsoever Thou pleasest and Thou abasest whomsoever Thou pleasest. In Thy hand is all good. Thou surely hast power to do all things."
‘Thou makest the night pass into the day and makest the day pass into the night. And Thou bringest forth the living from the dead and bringest forth the dead from the living. And Thou givest to whomsoever Thou pleasest without measure.’
Let not the believers take disbelievers for friends in preference to believers — and whoever does that has no connection with Allah — except that you cautiously guard against them. And Allah cautions you against His punishment; and to Allah is the returning.
"Say, ‘Whether you conceal what is in your breasts or reveal it, Allah knows it; and He knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. And Allah has power to do all things.’"
(Beware of) the Day when every soul shall find itself confronted with (all) the good it has done and (all) the evil it has done. It will wish there were a great distance between it and that (evil). And Allah cautions you against His punishment. And Allah is Most Compassionate to (His) servants.
"Say, ‘If you love Allah, follow me: (then) will Allah love you and forgive you your faults. And Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful.’"
"Say, ‘Obey Allah and the Messenger;’ but if they turn away, then (remember that) Allah loves not the disbelievers."
Allah did choose Adam and Noah and the family of Abraham and the family of ‘Imran above all peoples  — 
"A race, co-related with one another. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
"(Remember) when (the) woman of ‘Imran said, ‘My Lord, I have vowed to Thee what is in my womb to be dedicated to Thy service. So do accept it of me; verily, Thou alone art All-Hearing, All-Knowing.’"
"But when she was delivered of it, she said, ‘My Lord, I am delivered of a female’ — and Allah knew best what she had brought forth and the male (she was thinking of) was not like the female (she had brought forth) — ‘and I have named her Mary, and I commit her and her offspring to Thy protection from Satan, the rejected.’"
"So her Lord accepted her with a gracious acceptance and caused her to grow an excellent growth and made Zachariah her guardian. Whenever Zachariah visited her in the chamber, he found with her provisions. He said, ‘O Mary, whence hast thou this?’ She replied, ‘It is from Allah.’ Surely, Allah gives to whomsoever He pleases without measure."
"There (and then) did Zachariah pray to his Lord, saying, ‘My Lord, grant me from Thyself pure offspring; surely, Thou art the Hearer of prayer.’"
"And the angels called to him as he stood praying in the chamber: ‘Allah gives thee glad tidings of Yahya, who shall testify to the truth of a word from Allah — noble and chaste and a Prophet, from among the righteous.’"
"He said, ‘My Lord, how shall I have a son, when age has overtaken me, and my wife is barren?’ He answered, ‘Such is (the way of) Allah: He does what He pleases.’"
"He said, ‘My Lord, appoint a token for me.’ He replied, ‘Thy token shall be that thou shalt not speak to men for three days except by signs. And remember thy Lord much and glorify Him in the evening and in the early morning.’"
"And (remember) when the angels said, ‘O Mary, Allah has chosen thee and purified thee and chosen thee above the women of all peoples."
"‘O Mary, be obedient to thy Lord and prostrate thyself and worship (God alone) with those who worship.’"
"This is of the tidings of things unseen which We reveal to thee. And thou wast not with them when they cast their arrows, as to which of them should be the guardian of Mary, nor wast thou with them when they disputed with one another."
"When the angels said, ‘O Mary, Allah gives thee glad tidings of a word from Him; his name (shall be) the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, honoured in this world and in the next, and of those who are granted nearness (to God);"
"‘And he shall speak to the people in the cradle and when of middle age, and he shall be of the righteous.’"
"She said, ‘My Lord, how shall I have a son, when no man has touched me?’ He said, “Such is (the way of) Allah, He creates what He pleases. When He decrees a thing, He says to it, ‘Be!’ and it is."
“And He will teach him the Book and the Wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel;
"“And (will make him) a Messenger to the children of Israel (to say): ‘I come to you with a Sign from your Lord, (which is), that I will fashion out for you (a creation) out of clay after the manner of a bird, then I will breathe into it (a new spirit) and it will become a soaring being by the command of Allah; and I will heal the night-blind and the leprous, and I will quicken the dead, by the command of Allah; and I will announce to you what you will eat and what you will store up in your houses. Surely, therein is a Sign for you, if you be believers."
"‘And (I come) fulfilling that which is before me, namely, the Torah; and to allow you some of that which was forbidden you; and I come to you with a Sign from your Lord; so fear Allah and obey me."
"‘Surely, Allah is my Lord and your Lord; so worship Him: this is the right path.’ ”"
"And when Jesus perceived their disbelief, he said, ‘Who will be my helpers in the cause of Allah?’ The disciples answered, ‘We are the helpers of Allah. We have believed in Allah. And bear thou witness that we are obedient."
"‘Our Lord, we believe in that which Thou hast sent down and we follow this Messenger. So write us down among those who bear witness.’"
"And they planned, and Allah (also) planned; and Allah is the Best of planners."
"When Allah said, ‘O Jesus, I will cause thee to die (a natural death) and will exalt thee to Myself, and will clear thee from (the charges of) those who disbelieve, and will place those who follow thee above those who disbelieve, until the Day of Resurrection; then to Me shall be your return, and I will judge between you concerning that wherein you differ."
"‘Then as for those who disbelieve, I will punish them with a severe punishment in this world and in the next, and they shall have no helpers."
"‘And as for those who believe and do good works, He will pay them their full rewards. And Allah loves not the wrongdoers.’"
That is what We recite unto thee of the Signs and the wise Reminder.
"Surely, the case of Jesus with Allah is like the case of Adam. He created him out of dust, then He said to him, ‘Be!,’ and he was."
"(This is) the truth from thy Lord, so be thou not of those who doubt."
"Now whoso disputes with thee concerning him, after what has come to thee of knowledge, say (to him), ‘Come, let us call our sons and your sons, and our women and your women, and our people and your people; then let us pray fervently and invoke the curse of Allah on those who lie.’"
"This certainly is the true account. There is none worthy of worship save Allah; and surely, it is Allah Who is the Mighty, the Wise."
"But if they turn away, then (remember that) Allah knows the mischief-makers well."
"Say, ‘O People of the Book! come to a word equal between us and you — that we worship none but Allah, and that we associate no partner with Him, and that some of us take not others for Lords beside Allah.’ But if they turn away, then say, ‘Bear witness that we have submitted (to God).’"
"O People of the Book! why do you dispute concerning Abraham, when the Torah and the Gospel were not revealed till after him? Will you not then understand?"
"Behold! you are those who disputed about that whereof you had knowledge. Why then do you (now) dispute about that whereof you have no knowledge (at all)? Allah knows, and you know not."
"Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was ever inclined (to God and) obedient (to Him), and he was not of those who associate gods (with God)."
"Surely, the nearest of men to Abraham are those who followed him, and this Prophet and those who believe; and Allah is the friend of believers."
"A section of the People of the Book would fain lead you astray; but they lead astray none except themselves, only they perceive not."
"O People of the Book! why do you deny the Signs of Allah, while you are witnesses thereof ?"
O People of the Book! why do you confound truth with falsehood and hide the truth knowingly?
"And a section of the People of the Book say, ‘Believe in that which has been revealed unto the believers, in the early part of day, and disbelieve in the latter part thereof; perchance they may return;"
"‘And obey none but him who follows your religion;’ — Say, ‘Surely, the (true) guidance, the guidance of Allah, is that one may be given the like of that which has been given to you’ — ‘or they would dispute with you before your Lord.’ Say, ‘All bounty is in the hand of Allah. He gives it to whomsoever He pleases. And Allah is Bountiful, All-Knowing."
‘He chooses for His mercy whomsoever He pleases. And Allah is Lord of exceeding bounty.’
"Among the People of the Book there is he who, if thou trust him with a treasure, will return it to thee; and among them there is he who, if thou trust him with a dinar, will not return it to thee, unless thou keep standing over him. That is because they say, ‘We are not liable to blame in the matter of the unlearned;’ and they utter a lie against Allah knowingly."
"Nay, but whoso fulfils his pledge and fears God — verily, Allah loves the God-fearing."
"(As for) those who take a paltry price in exchange for (their) covenant with Allah and their oaths, they shall have no portion in the life to come, and Allah will neither speak to them nor look upon them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them; and for them shall be a grievous punishment."
"And, surely, among them is a section who twist their tongues while reciting the Book; that you may think it (to be part) of the Book, while it is not (part) of the Book. And they say, ‘It is from Allah;’ while it is not from Allah; and they utter a lie against Allah knowingly."
"It is not (possible) for a man that Allah should give him the Book and dominion and prophethood, (and) then he should say to men: ‘Be servants to me and not to Allah;’ but (he would say): ‘Be solely devoted to the Lord because you teach the Book and because you study (it).’"
Nor (is it possible for him) that he should bid you take the angels and the Prophets for Lords. Would he enjoin you to disbelieve after you have submitted (to God)?
"And (remember the time) when Allah took a covenant from (the people through) the Prophets, (saying): ‘Whatever I give you of the Book and Wisdom (and) then there comes to you a Messenger, fulfilling that which is with you, you shall believe in him and help him.’ (And) He said: ‘Do you agree, and do you accept the responsibility which I lay upon you in this (matter)?’ They said, ‘We agree;’ He said, ‘Then bear witness, and I am with you among the witnesses.’"
"Now whoso turns away after this, then, surely, those are the transgressors."
"Do they seek a religion other than Allah’s, while to Him submits whosoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, and to Him shall they be returned?"
"Say, ‘We believe in Allah and in that which has been revealed to us, and that which was revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Tribes, and that which was given to Moses and Jesus and (other) Prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we submit.’"
"And whoso seeks a religion other than Islam, it shall not be accepted from him, and in the life to come he shall be among the losers."
How shall Allah guide a people who have disbelieved after believing and who had borne witness that the Messenger was true and to whom clear proofs had come? And Allah guides not the wrongdoing people.
"Of such the reward is that on them shall be the curse of Allah and of angels and of men, all together."
They shall abide thereunder. Their punishment shall not be lightened nor shall they be reprieved;
"Except those who repent thereafter and amend. And surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"Surely, those who disbelieve after they have believed and then increase in disbelief, their repentance shall not be accepted, and these are they who have gone astray."
"(As for) those who have disbelieved, and die while they are disbelievers, there shall not be accepted from any one of them (even) an earthful of gold, though he offer it in ransom. It is these for whom shall be a grievous punishment, and they shall have no helpers."
"Never shall you attain to righteousness unless you spend out of that which you love; and whatever you spend, Allah surely knows it well."
"All food was lawful to the children of Israel, except what Israel forbade himself before the Torah was sent down. Say, ‘Bring, then, the Torah and read it, if you are truthful.’"
"Now whoso forges a lie against Allah after this, then it is these that are the wrongdoers."
"Say, ‘Allah has spoken the truth: follow, therefore, the religion of Abraham, (who was) ever inclined (to God); and he was not of those who associate gods (with God).’"
"Surely, the first House founded for mankind is that at Becca, abounding in blessings and a guidance for all peoples."
"In it are manifest Signs; it is the place of Abraham; and whoso enters it, enters peace. And pilgrimage to the House is a duty which men — those who can find a way thither — owe to Allah. And whoever disbelieves, (let him remember) that Allah is surely independent of all creatures."
"Say, ‘O People of the Book! why deny ye the Signs of Allah, while Allah is Watchful of what you do?’"
"Say, ‘O People of the Book! why hinder ye the believers from the path of Allah, seeking to make it crooked, while you are witnesses (thereof) ? And Allah is not unmindful of what you do.’"
"O ye who believe! if you obey any party of those who have been given the Book, they will turn you again into disbelievers after you have believed."
"How would you disbelieve, while to you are rehearsed the Signs of Allah, and His Messenger is present among you? And he who holds fast to Allah is indeed guided to the right path."
O ye who believe! fear Allah as He should be feared; and let not death overtake you except when you are in a state of submission.
"And hold fast, all together, by the rope of Allah and be not divided; and remember the favour of Allah which He bestowed upon you when you were enemies and He united your hearts in love, so that by His grace you became (as) brothers; and you were on the brink of a pit of fire and He saved you from it. Thus does Allah explain to you His commandments that you may be guided."
"And let there be among you a body of men who should invite to goodness, and enjoin equity and forbid evil. And it is they who shall prosper."
"And be not like those who became divided and who disagreed (among themselves) after clear proofs had come to them. And it is they for whom there shall be a great punishment,"
"On the day when some faces shall be white, and some faces shall be black. As for those whose faces will be black, (it will be said to them): ‘Did you disbelieve after believing? Taste, then, the punishment because you disbelieved.’"
"And as for those whose faces will be white, they will be in the mercy of Allah; therein will they abide."
"These are the Signs of Allah, We rehearse them to thee while they comprise the truth; and Allah wills not any wrong to (His) creatures."
"And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and to Allah shall all affairs be returned (for decision)."
"You are the best people raised for the good of mankind; you enjoin what is good and forbid evil and believe in Allah. And if the People of the Book had believed, it would have surely been better for them. Some of them are believers, but most of them are disobedient."
"They cannot harm you save a slight hurt; and if they fight you, they shall show you their backs. Then they shall not be helped."
"Smitten shall they be with abasement wherever they are found, unless they have protection from Allah, or protection from men. They have incurred the wrath of Allah, and smitten are they with wretchedness. That is because they would reject the Signs of Allah and kill the Prophets unjustly. That is because they rebelled and used to transgress."
They are not (all) alike. Among the People of the Book there is a party who stand (by their covenant); they recite the word of Allah in the hours of night and prostrate themselves (before Him).
"They believe in Allah and the Last Day, and enjoin what is good and forbid evil, and hasten, vying with one another, in good works. And these are among the righteous."
"And whatever good they do, they shall not be denied its due reward; and Allah well knows the God-fearing."
"As for those who disbelieve, their possessions and their children shall not avail them aught against Allah; and these are the inmates of the Fire; therein shall they abide."
"The likeness of what they spend for the present life is as the likeness of a wind wherein there is intense cold which smites the harvest of a people who have wronged themselves, and destroys it. And Allah has not wronged them, but they wrong themselves."
"O ye who believe! take not (others) than your own people as intimate friends; they will not fail to corrupt you. They love to see you in trouble. Hatred has already shown itself through (the utterances of) their mouths, and what their breasts conceal is greater still. We have made clear to you Our commandments, if you will understand."
"Behold, you are those who love them, but they love you not. And you believe in all the Book. When they meet you, they say, ‘We believe;’ but when they are alone, they bite their finger-tips at you for rage. Say, ‘Perish in your rage. Surely, Allah knows well what is hidden in (your) breasts.’"
"If anything good befall you, it grieves them; and if an evil befall you, they rejoice thereat. But if you be steadfast and righteous, their designs will not harm you at all; surely, Allah encompasses (all) that they do."
"And (remember the time) when thou didst go forth early in the morning from thy household, assigning to the believers their positions for battle. And Allah is All- Hearing, All-Knowing;"
"When two of your groups meditated cowardice, although Allah was their friend. And upon Allah should the believers rely."
And Allah had (already) helped you at Badr when you were weak. So take Allah for your Protector that you may be grateful.
"When thou didst say to the believers, ‘Will it not suffice you that your Lord should help you with three thousand angels sent down (from on high)?’"
"Yea, if you be steadfast and righteous and they come upon you immediately in hot haste, your Lord will help you with five thousand angels, attacking vehemently."
"And Allah has made it only as glad tidings for you and that your hearts might be at rest thereby; and help comes from Allah alone, the Mighty, the Wise."
(God will do so) that He might cut off a part of the disbelievers or abase them so that they might go back frustrated.
"Thou hast no concern in the matter: He may turn to them in mercy or punish them, for they are wrongdoers."
"And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. He forgives whomsoever He pleases and punishes whomsoever He pleases, and Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
O ye who believe! devour not interest involving diverse additions; and fear Allah that you may prosper.
And fear the Fire prepared for the disbelievers.
And obey Allah and the Messenger that you be shown mercy.
"And vie with one another in asking for forgiveness from your Lord, and for a Paradise whose price is the heavens and the earth, prepared for the God-fearing — "
"Those who spend in prosperity and adversity, and those who suppress anger and pardon men; and Allah loves those who do good;"
"And those who, when they commit a foul deed or wrong themselves, remember Allah and implore forgiveness for their sins —  and who can forgive sins except Allah? — and do not persist knowingly in what they have done."
"It is these whose reward is forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they shall abide; and how good is the reward of those who work!"
"Surely, there have been (many) dispensations before you; so travel through the earth and see how (evil) was the end of those who treated (the Prophets) as liars."
"This (the Qur’an) is a clear demonstration to men, and a guidance and an admonition to the Godfearing."
"Slacken not, nor grieve; and you shall certainly have the upper hand, if you are believers."
"If you have received an injury, surely the (disbelieving) people have (already) received a similar injury. And such days We cause to alternate among men (that they may be admonished), and that Allah may distinguish those who believe and may take witnesses from among you; and Allah loves not the unjust;"
"And that Allah may purify those who believe, and destroy the disbelievers."
Do you suppose that you will enter Heaven while Allah has not yet distinguished those of you that strive (in the way of Allah) and has not yet distinguished the steadfast?
And you used to wish for this death before you met it; now you have seen it while you were (actually) looking for (it).
"And Muhammad is only a Messenger. Verily, (all) Messengers have passed away before him. If then he die or be slain, will you turn back on your heels? And he who turns back on his heels shall not harm Allah at all. And Allah will certainly reward the grateful."
"And no soul can die except by Allah’s leave — a decree with a fixed term. And whoever desires the reward of the present world, We will give him thereof; and whoever desires the reward of the life to come, We will give him thereof; and We will surely reward the grateful."
"And many a Prophet there has been beside whom fought numerous companies (of their followers). They slackened not for aught that befell them in the way of Allah, nor did they weaken, nor did they humiliate themselves (before the enemy). And Allah loves the steadfast."
"And they uttered not a word except that they said: ‘Our Lord, forgive us our errors and our excesses in our conduct, and make firm our steps and help us against the disbelieving people.’"
"So Allah gave them the reward of this world, as also an excellent reward of the next; and Allah loves those who do good."
"O ye who believe! if you obey those who have disbelieved, they will cause you to turn back on your heels, and you will become losers."
"Nay, Allah is your Protector, and He is the Best of helpers."
We shall strike terror into the hearts of those that have disbelieved because they associate partners with Allah for which He has sent down no authority. Their abode is the Fire; and evil is the habitation of the wrongdoers.
"And Allah had surely made good to you His promise when you were slaying and destroying them by His leave, until, when you became lax and disagreed among yourselves concerning the order and you disobeyed after He had shown you that which you loved, (He withdrew His help). Among you were those who desired the present world, and among you were those who desired the next. Then He turned you away from them, that He might try you — and He has surely pardoned you, and Allah is Gracious to the believers. — "
"When you were running away and looked not back at anyone while the Messenger was calling out to you from your rear, then He gave you a sorrow in recompense for a sorrow, that you might not grieve for what escaped you, nor for what befell you. And Allah is well aware of what you do."
"Then, after the sorrow, He sent down peace on you — a slumber that overcame a party of you — while the other party was anxious concerning their own selves, thinking wrongly of Allah (like unto) the thought of ignorance. They said, ‘Is there for us any part in the government (of affairs)?’ Say, ‘All government belongs to Allah.’ They hide in their minds what they disclose not to thee. They say, ‘If we had any part in the government (of affairs), we should not have been killed here.’ Say, ‘If you had remained in your homes, surely those on whom fighting had been enjoined would have gone forth to their deathbeds,’ (that Allah might bring about His decree) and that Allah might test what was in your breasts and that He might purge what was in your hearts. And Allah knows well what is in the minds;"
"Those of you who turned their backs on the day when the two hosts met, surely it was Satan who sought to make them slip because of certain doings of theirs. But certainly Allah has already pardoned them. Verily, Allah is Most Forgiving, Forbearing."
"O ye who believe! be not like those who have disbelieved, and who say of their brethren when they travel in the land or go forth to war: ‘Had they been with us, they would not have died or been slain.’ (This is so), that Allah may make it a cause of regret in their hearts. And Allah gives life and causes death and Allah is Mindful of what you do."
"And if you are slain in the cause of Allah or you die, surely forgiveness from Allah and mercy shall be better than what they hoard."
"And if you die or be slain, surely unto Allah shall you be gathered together."
"And it is by the (great) mercy of Allah that thou art kind towards them, and if thou hadst been rough (and) hard-hearted, they would surely have dispersed from around thee. So pardon them and ask forgiveness for them, and consult them in matters (of administration); and when thou art determined, then put thy trust in Allah. Surely, Allah loves those who put their trust (in Him)."
"If Allah help you, none shall overcome you; but if He forsake you, then who is there that can help you beside Him? In Allah, then, let the believers put their trust."
"And it is not possible for a Prophet to act dishonestly, and whoever acts dishonestly shall bring (with him) that about which he has been dishonest, on the Day of Resurrection. Then shall every soul be fully paid what it has earned; and they shall not be wronged."
Is he who follows the pleasure of Allah like him who draws on himself the wrath of Allah and whose abode is Hell? And an evil retreat it is!
They have (different) grades (of grace) with Allah; and Allah sees what they do.
"Verily, Allah has conferred a favour on the believers by raising among them a Messenger from among themselves, who recites to them His Signs, and purifies them and teaches them the Book and Wisdom; and, before that, they were surely in manifest error."
"What! when a misfortune befalls you — and you had inflicted the double of that — you say, whence is this? Say, ‘It is from your own selves.’ Surely, Allah has power over all things."
"And that which befell you, on the day when the two parties met, was by Allah’s command; and (this was so) that He might distinguish the believers;"
"And that He might distinguish the hypocrites. And it was said to them, ‘Come ye, fight in the cause of Allah and repel (the attack of the enemy);’ they said, ‘If we knew how to fight, we would surely follow you.’ They were, that day, nearer to disbelief than to belief. They say with their mouths what is not in their hearts. And Allah knows well what they conceal."
"(It is these) who said of their brethren, while they (themselves) remained behind, ‘If they had obeyed us, they would not have been slain.’ Say, ‘Then avert death from yourselves, if you are truthful.’"
"Think not of those, who have been slain in the cause of Allah, as dead. Nay, they are living, in the presence of their Lord, (and) are granted gifts (from Him),"
"Jubilant because of that which Allah has given them of His bounty; and rejoicing for those who have not yet joined them from behind them, because on them (shall come) no fear, nor shall they grieve."
"They rejoice at the favour of Allah and (His) bounty, and (at the fact) that Allah suffers not the reward of the believers to be lost."
(As to) those who answered the call of Allah and the Messenger after they had received an injury —  such of them as do good and act righteously shall have a great reward;
"Those to whom men said, ‘People have mustered against you, therefore fear them,’ but this (only) increased their faith, and they said, ‘Sufficient for us is Allah, and an excellent Guardian is He.’"
"So they returned with a (mighty) favour from Allah and a (great) bounty, while no evil had touched them; and they followed the pleasure of Allah; and Allah is the Lord of great bounty."
"It is Satan who only frightens his friends; so fear them not but fear Me, if you are believers."
"And let not those who hastily fall into disbelief grieve thee; surely, they cannot harm Allah in any way. Allah desires not to assign any portion for them in the life to come; and they shall have a severe punishment."
"Surely, those who have purchased disbelief at the price of faith cannot harm Allah at all; and they shall have a grievous punishment."
And let not the disbelievers think that Our granting them respite is good for them; (the result of) Our granting them respite will only be that they will increase in sin; and they shall have an humiliating punishment.
"Allah would not leave the believers as you are, until He separated the wicked from the good. Nor would Allah reveal to you the unseen. But Allah chooses of His Messengers whom He pleases. Believe, therefore, in Allah and His Messengers. If you believe and be righteous, you shall have a great reward."
"And let not those, who are niggardly with respect to what Allah has given them of His bounty, think that it is good for them; nay, it is evil for them. That with respect to which they were niggardly shall be put as a collar round their necks on the Day of Resurrection. And to Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is well aware of what you do."
"And surely Allah has heard the utterance of those who said, ‘Allah is poor and we are rich.’ We shall record what they have said, and their attempts to kill the Prophets unjustly; and We shall say, ‘Taste ye the punishment of burning.’"
"That is because of that which your hands have sent on before (yourselves), and (the truth is) that Allah is not at all unjust to (His) servants."
"Those who say, ‘Allah has charged us not to believe in any Messenger until he bring us an offering which fire devours.’ Say, ‘There have already come to you Messengers before me with clear Signs and with that which you speak of. Why, then, did you seek to kill them, if you are truthful?’"
"And if they accuse thee of lying, even so were accused of lying Messengers before thee who came with clear Signs and books of wisdom and the shining Book."
Every soul shall taste of death. And you shall be paid in full your rewards only on the Day of Resurrection. So whosoever is removed away from the Fire and is made to enter Heaven has indeed attained his goal. And the life of this world is nothing but an illusory enjoyment.
"You shall surely be tried in your possessions and in your persons and you shall surely hear many hurtful things from those who were given the Book before you and from those who set up equals (to God). But if you show fortitude and act righteously, that indeed is (a matter) of strong determination."
"And (remember) when Allah took a covenant from those who were given the Book, (saying), ‘You shall make this (Book) known to the people and not conceal it.’ But they threw it away behind their backs, and bartered it for a paltry price. Evil is that which they have purchased."
"Think not that those who exult in what they have done, and love to be praised for what they have not done — think not that they are secure from punishment. They shall suffer a grievous chastisement."
And to Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; and Allah has power over all things.
In the creation of the heavens and the earth and in the alternation of the night and the day there are indeed Signs for men of understanding;
"Those who remember Allah while standing, sitting, and (lying) on their sides, and ponder over the creation of the heavens and the earth: “Our Lord, Thou hast not created this in vain; (nay), Holy art Thou; save us, then, from the punishment of the Fire."
"“Our Lord, whomsoever Thou causest to enter the Fire, him hast Thou surely disgraced. And the wrongdoers shall have no helpers."
"“Our Lord, we have heard a Crier calling (us) unto faith, ‘Believe ye in your Lord,’ and we have believed. Our Lord, forgive us, therefore, our errors and remove from us our evils, and in death number us with the righteous."
"“Our Lord, give us what Thou hast promised to us through Thy Messengers; and disgrace us not on the Day of Resurrection. Surely, Thou breakest not Thy promise.”"
"So their Lord answered their (prayers, saying), ‘I will allow not the work of any worker from among you, whether male or female, to be lost. You are from one another. Those, therefore, who have emigrated, and have been driven out from their homes, and have been persecuted in My cause, and have fought and been killed, I will surely remove from them their evils and will cause them to enter Gardens through which streams flow — a reward from Allah, and with Allah is the best of rewards.’"
Let not the moving about of the disbelievers in the land deceive thee.
"(It is) a small (and brief) advantage, then Hell shall be their abode. What an evil place of rest!"
But those who fear their Lord shall have Gardens through which streams flow; therein shall they abide — an entertainment from Allah. And that which is with Allah is still better for the righteous.
"And surely among the People of the Book there are some who believe in Allah and in what has been sent down to you and in what was sent down to them, humbling themselves before Allah. They barter not the Signs of Allah for a paltry price. It is these who shall have their reward with their Lord. Surely, Allah is swift to take account."
O ye who believe! be steadfast and strive to excel in steadfastness and be on (your) guard and fear Allah that you may prosper.
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"O ye people! fear your Lord, Who created you from a single soul and created therefrom its mate, and from them twain spread many men and women; and fear Allah, in Whose name you appeal to one another, and (fear Him particularly respecting) ties of relationship. Verily, Allah watches over you."
"And give to the orphans their property and exchange not the bad for the good, and devour not their property with your own. Surely, it is a great sin."
"And if you fear that you will not be fair in dealing with the orphans, then marry of women as may be agreeable to you, two, or three, or four; and if you fear you will not deal justly, then (marry only) one or what your right hands possess. That is the nearest (way) for you to avoid injustice."
"And give the women their dowries willingly. But if they, of their own pleasure, remit to you a part thereof, then enjoy it as something pleasant and wholesome."
And give not to the foolish your property which Allah has made for you a means of support; but feed them therewith and clothe them and speak to them words of kind advice.
"And prove the orphans until they attain (the age of) marriage; then, if you find in them sound judgment, deliver to them their property; and devour it not in extravagance and haste against their growing up. And whoso is rich, let him abstain; and whoso is poor, let him eat (thereof) with equity. And when you deliver to them their property, then call witnesses in their presence. And Allah is sufficient as a Reckoner."
"For men is a share of that which parents and near relations leave; and for women is a share of that which parents and near relations leave, whether it be little or much — a determined share."
"And when (other) relations and orphans and the poor are present at the division (of heritage), give them (something) therefrom and speak to them words of kindness."
"And let those fear (God) who, if they should leave behind them their own weak offspring, would be anxious for them. Let them, therefore, fear Allah and let them say the right word."
"Surely, they who devour the property of orphans unjustly, only swallow fire into their bellies, and they shall burn in a blazing fire."
"Allah commands you concerning your children: a male shall have as much as the share of two females; but if there be females (only, numbering) more than two, then they shall have two-thirds of what the (deceased) leaves; and if there be one, she shall have the half. And his parents shall have each of them a sixth of the inheritance, if he have a child; but if he have no child and his parents be his heirs, then his mother shall have a third; and if he have brothers and sisters, then his mother shall have a sixth, after (the payment of) any bequests he may have bequeathed or of debt. Your fathers and your children, you know not which of them is nearest to you in benefit. (This) fixing (of portions) is from Allah. Surely, Allah is All- Knowing, Wise."
"And you shall have half of that which your wives leave, if they have no child; but if they have a child, then you shall have a fourth of that which they leave, after (the payment of) any bequests they may have bequeathed or of debt. And they shall have a fourth of that which you leave, if you have no child; but if you have a child, then they shall have an eighth of that which you leave, after (the payment of) any bequests you may have bequeathed or of debt. And if there be a man or a woman whose heritage is to be divided and he (or she) has neither parent nor child, and he (or she) has a brother or a sister, then each one of them shall have a sixth. But if they be more than that, then they shall be (equal) sharers in one-third, after (the payment of) any bequests which may have been bequeathed or of debt, without prejudice (to the debt). (This is) an injunction from Allah, and Allah is All-Knowing, Forbearing."
"These are the limits (set) by Allah; and whoso obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will make him enter Gardens through which streams flow; therein shall they abide; and that is a great triumph."
"And whoso disobeys Allah and His Messenger and transgresses His limits, He will make him enter into Fire; therein shall he abide; and he shall have an humiliating punishment."
"And those of your women who are guilty of lewdness — call to witness four of you against them; and if they bear witness, then confine them to the houses until death overtake them or Allah open for them a way."
"And if two men from among you are guilty of it, punish them both. And if they repent and amend, then leave them alone; surely, Allah is Oft-Returning (with compassion and is) Merciful."
"Verily, Allah undertakes to accept the repentance of only those who do evil ignorantly and then repent soon after. These are they to whom Allah turns with mercy; and Allah is All-Knowing, Wise."
"There is no (acceptance of) repentance for those who (continue to) do evil until, when death faces one of them, he says, ‘I do repent now;’ nor for those who die disbelievers. It is these for whom We have prepared a painful punishment."
"O ye who believe! it is not lawful for you to inherit women against their will; nor should you detain them wrongfully that you may take away part of that which you have given them, except that they be guilty of a flagrant evil; and consort with them in kindness; and if you dislike them, it may be that you dislike a thing wherein Allah has placed much good."
"And if you desire to take one wife in place of another and you have given one of them a treasure, take not aught therefrom. Will you take it by lying and with manifest sinfulness?"
"And how can you take it when one of you has been alone with the other, and they (the women) have taken from you a strong covenant?"
"And marry not those women whom your fathers married, except what has already passed. It is a thing foul and hateful and an evil way."
"Forbidden to you are your mothers, and your daughters, and your sisters, and your fathers’ sisters, and your mothers’ sisters, and brother’s daughters, and sister’s daughters, and your (foster)-mothers that have given you suck, and your foster-sisters, and the mothers of your wives, and your stepdaughters, who are your wards by your wives unto whom you have gone in — but if you have not gone in unto them, there shall be no sin upon you — and the wives of your sons that are from your loins; and (it is forbidden to you) to have two sisters together (in marriage), except what has already passed; surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"And (forbidden to you are) married women, except such as your right hands possess. This has Allah enjoined on you. And allowed to you are those beyond that, that you seek (them) by means of your property, marrying them properly and not committing fornication. And for the benefit you receive from them, give them their dowries, as fixed, and there shall be no sin for you in anything you mutually agree upon, after the fixing (of the dowry). Surely, Allah is All-Knowing, Wise."
"And whoso of you cannot afford to marry free, believing women, (let him) marry what your right hands possess, namely, your believing handmaids. And Allah knows your faith best; you are (all) one from another; so marry them with the leave of their masters and give them their dowries according to what is fair, they being chaste, not committing fornication, nor taking secret paramours. And if, after they are married, they are guilty of lewdness, they shall have half the punishment prescribed for free women. This is for him among you who fears lest he should commit sin. And that you restrain yourselves is better for you; and Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"Allah desires to make clear to you, and guide you to, the paths of those before you, and to turn to you in mercy. And Allah is All- Knowing, Wise."
"And Allah wishes to turn to you in mercy, but those who follow (their) low desires wish that you should stray far away."
"Allah desires to lighten your burden, for man has been created weak."
"O ye who believe! devour not your property among yourselves by unlawful means, except that (you earn) by trade with mutual consent. And kill not yourselves. Surely, Allah is Merciful to you."
"And whosoever does that by way of transgression and injustice, We shall cast him into Fire; and that is easy with Allah."
"If you keep away from the more grievous of the things which are forbidden you, We will remove from you your (minor) evils and admit you to a place of great honour."
"And covet not that whereby Allah has made some of you excel others. Men shall have a share of that which they have earned, and women a share of that which they have earned. And ask Allah of His bounty. Surely, Allah has perfect knowledge of all things."
"And to every one We have appointed heirs to what the parents and the relations leave, and (also) those with whom your oaths have ratified a contract. So give them their portion. Surely, Allah watches over all things."
"Men are guardians over women because Allah has made some of them excel others, and because they (men) spend of their wealth. So virtuous women (are those who) are obedient, and guard the secrets (of their husbands) with Allah’s protection. And (as for) those on whose part you fear disobedience, admonish them and leave them alone in their beds, and chastise them. Then if they obey you, seek not a way against them. Surely, Allah is High, Great."
"And if you fear a breach between them, then appoint an arbiter from his folk and an orbiter from her folk. If they (the arbiters) desire reconciliation, Allah will effect it between them. Surely, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware."
"And worship Allah and associate naught with Him, and (show) kindness to parents, and to kindred, and orphans, and the needy, and to the neighbour that is a kinsman and the neighbour that is a stranger, and the companion by (your) side, and the wayfarer, and those whom your right hands possess. Surely, Allah loves not the proud (and) the boastful,"
"Who are niggardly and enjoin people to be niggardly, and conceal that which Allah has given them of His bounty. And We have prepared for the disbelievers an humiliating punishment,"
"And for those who spend their wealth to be seen of men, and believe not in Allah nor the Last Day. And whoso has Satan for his companion, (let him remember that) an evil companion is he."
"And what (harm) would have befallen them, if they had believed in Allah and the Last Day and spent out of what Allah has given them? And Allah knows them full well."
"Surely, Allah wrongs not (any one even) by the weight of an atom. And if there be a good deed, He multiplies it and gives from Himself a great reward."
"And how (will it fare with them) when We shall bring a witness from every people, and shall bring thee as a witness against these!"
"On that day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger will wish that the earth were made level with them, and they shall not (be able to) conceal anything from Allah."
"O ye who believe! approach not Prayer when you are not in (full) possession of your senses, until you know what you say, nor when you are unclean, except when you are travelling along a way, until you have bathed. And if you are ill or (you are) on a journey (while unclean), or (if) one of you comes from the privy or you have touched women and you find no water, then betake yourselves to pure dust and wipe therewith your faces and your hands. Surely, Allah is Most Indulgent, Most Forgiving."
Dost thou not know of those who were given a portion of the Book? They buy error and desire that you (too) may lose the way.
"And Allah knows your enemies full well. And sufficient is Allah as a Friend, and sufficient is Allah as a Helper."
"There are some among the Jews who pervert words from their (proper) places. And they say, ‘We hear and we disobey,’ and ‘hear (thou) without being heard,’ and ‘Ra‘ina,’ screening with their tongues (what is in their minds) and (seeking) to injure the Faith. And if they had said, ‘We hear and we obey,’ and ‘hear (thou),’ and ‘Unzurna,’ it would have been better for them and more upright. But Allah has cursed them for their disbelief; so they believe but little."
"O ye People of the Book! believe in what We have sent down, fulfilling that which is with you, before We destroy (some of) the leaders and turn them on their backs or curse them as We cursed the People of the Sabbath. And the decree of Allah is (bound) to be carried out."
"Surely, Allah will not forgive that any partner be associated with Him; but He will forgive whatever is short of that to whomsoever He pleases. And whoso associates partners with Allah has indeed devised a very great sin."
"Dost thou not know of those who hold themselves to be pure? Nay, it is Allah Who purifies whomsoever He pleases, and they will not be wronged a whit."
"Behold, how they forge a lie against Allah! And sufficient is that as a manifest sin."
"Dost thou not know of those who were given a portion of the Book? They believe in evil things and (follow) those who transgress, and they say of the disbelievers, ‘These are better guided in religion than those who believe.’"
"They it is whom Allah has cursed; and he whom Allah curses, thou shalt not find for him a helper."
Have they a share in the kingdom? Then would they not give men (even so much as) the little hollow in the back of a date-stone.
"Or do they envy men for what Allah has given them out of His bounty? (If that is so), surely, We gave the Book and Wisdom to the children of Abraham (also) and We (also) gave them a great kingdom."
And of them were some who believed in him; and of them were others who turned away from him. And sufficient is Hell as a blazing fire.
"Those who disbelieve in Our Signs, We shall soon cause them to enter Fire. As often as their skins are burnt up, We shall give them in exchange other skins that they may taste the punishment. Surely, Allah is Mighty, Wise."
"And those who believe and do good works, We shall make them enter Gardens through which streams flow, to abide therein for ever; therein shall they have pure spouses; and We shall admit them to a (place of) pleasant and plenteous shade."
"Verily, Allah commands you to make over the trusts to those entitled to them, and that, when you judge between men, you judge with justice. And surely excellent is that with which Allah admonishes you! Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing."
"O ye who believe! obey Allah, and obey (His) Messenger and those who are in authority among you. And if you differ in anything among yourselves, refer it to Allah and (His) Messenger if you are believers in Allah and the Last Day. That is best and most commendable in the end."
"Dost thou not know of those who pretend that they believe in what has been revealed to thee and what has been revealed before thee? They desire to seek judgment from the rebellious, although they were commanded not to obey them. And Satan desires to lead them far astray."
"And when it is said to them, ‘Come ye to what Allah has sent down and to (His) Messenger,’ thou seest the hypocrites turn away from thee with aversion."
"Then how is it that when an affliction befalls them because of what their hands have sent on before them, they come to thee swearing by Allah, (saying), ‘We meant nothing but the doing of good and reconciliation?’"
"These are they, the secrets of whose hearts Allah knows well. So turn away from them and admonish them and speak to them an effective word concerning their own selves."
"And We have sent no Messenger but that he should be obeyed by the command of Allah. And if they had come to thee when they had wronged their souls, and asked forgiveness of Allah, and (if) the Messenger (also) had asked forgiveness for them, they would have surely found Allah Oft-Returning (with compassion and) Merciful."
"But no, by thy Lord, they are not believres until they make thee judge in all that is in dispute between them and then find not in their hearts any demur concerning that which thou decidest and submit with full submission."
"And if We had commanded them, ‘Kill your people or leave your homes,’ they would not have done it except a few of them; and if they had done what they are exhorted to do, it would surely have been better for them and conducive to greater strength."
And then We would have surely given them a great reward from Ourself;
And We would surely have guided them in the right path.
"And whoso obeys Allah and this Messenger (of His) shall be among those on whom Allah has bestowed His blessings, namely, the Prophets, the Truthful, the Martyrs, and the Righteous. And excellent companions are these."
"This grace is from Allah, and sufficient is Allah, the All-Knowing."
O ye who believe! take your precautions; then either go forth in separate parties or go forth all together.
"And among you there is he who will tarry behind, and if a misfortune befall you, he says, ‘Surely, Allah has been gracious to me, since I was not present with them.’"
"But if there comes to you some good fortune from Allah, he says, as if there were no love between you and him, ‘Would that I had been with them, then should I have indeed achieved a great success!’"
"Let those then fight in the cause of Allah who would sell the present life for the Hereafter. And whoso fights in the cause of Allah, be he slain or be he victorious, We shall soon give him a great reward."
"And what is the matter with you (that) you fight not in the cause of Allah and of the weak — men, women and children — who say, ‘Our Lord, take us out of this town, whose people are oppressors, and make for us some friend from Thyself, and make for us from Thyself some helper?’"
"Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah, and those who disbelieve fight in the cause of the Evil One. Fight ye therefore against the friends of Satan; surely, Satan’s strategy is weak!"
"Dost thou not know of those to whom it was said: ‘Restrain your hands, observe Prayer and pay the Zakat?’ And when fighting has been prescribed for them, behold! a section of them fear men as they should fear Allah, or with still greater fear; and they say, ‘Our Lord, why hast Thou prescribed fighting for us? Wouldst Thou not grant us respite yet a while?’ Say, ‘The benefit of this world is little and the Hereafter will be better for him who fears (God); and you shall not be wronged a whit.’"
"Wheresoever you may be, death will overtake you, even if you be in strongly built towers. And if some good befalls them, they say, ‘This is from Allah;’ and if evil befalls them, they say, ‘This is from thee.’ Say, ‘All is from Allah.’ What has happened to these people that they come not near understanding anything?"
Whatever of good comes to thee is from Allah; and whatever of evil befalls thee is from thyself. And We have sent thee as a Messenger to mankind. And sufficient is Allah as a Witness.
"Whoso obeys the Messenger obeys Allah indeed; and whoso turns away, then We have not sent thee as a keeper over them."
"And they say: ‘Obedience (is our guiding principle);’ but when they go forth from thy presence, a section of them spends the night scheming against what thou sayest. Allah records whatever they scheme by night. So turn away from them, and put (thy) trust in Allah. And sufficient is Allah as a Disposer of affairs."
"Will they not, then, meditate upon the Qur’an? Had it been from anyone other than Allah, they would surely have found therein much disagreement."
"And when there comes to them any tidings (whether) of peace or of fear, they spread it about; whereas if they had referred it to the Messenger and to those in authority among them, surely those of them, who can elicit (the truth from) it, would have understood it. And had it not been for the grace of Allah upon you and His mercy, you would have followed Satan, save a few."
"Fight, therefore, in the cause of Allah — thou art not made responsible except for thyself — and urge on the believers. It may be that Allah will restrain the might of those that disbelieve; and Allah is stronger in might and stronger in inflicting punishment."
"Whoso makes a righteous intercession shall have a share thereof, and whoso makes an evil intercession, shall have a like portion thereof; and Allah is Powerful over everything."
"And when you are greeted with a prayer, greet ye with a better prayer or (at least) return it. Surely, Allah takes account of all things."
"Allah is He beside Whom there is none worthy of worship. He will certainly (continue to) assemble you till the Day of Resurrection, about which there is no doubt. And who is more truthful in his word than Allah?"
What has happened to you that you are divided into two parties regarding the hypocrites? And Allah has overthrown them because of what they earned. Desire ye to guide him whom Allah has caused to perish? And for him whom Allah causes to perish thou shalt not find a way.
"They wish that you should disbelieve as they have disbelieved, so that you may become all alike. Take not, therefore, friends from among them, until they emigrate in the way of Allah. And if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them; and take no friend nor helper from among them;"
"Except those who are connected with a people between whom and you there is a pact, or those who come to you, while their hearts shrink from fighting you or fighting their own people. And if Allah had so pleased, He would have given them power over you, then they would have surely fought you. So, if they keep aloof from you and fight you not, and make you an offer of peace, then (remember that) Allah has allowed you no way (of aggression) against them."
"You will find others who desire to be secure from you and to be secure from their own people. Whenever they are made to revert to hostility, they fall headlong into it. Therefore, if they do not keep aloof from you nor offer you peace nor restrain their hands, then seize them and kill them, wherever you find them. Against these We have given you clear authority."
"It does not become a believer to kill a believer unless it be by mistake. And he who kills a believer by mistake shall free a believing slave, and (pay) blood money to be handed over to his heirs, unless they remit it as charity. But if (the person slain) be of a people hostile to you, and be a believer, then (the offender) shall free a believing slave; and if he be of a people between whom and you is a pact, then (the offender shall pay) blood money to be handed over to his heirs, and free a believing slave. But whoso finds not (one), then he shall fast for two consecutive months — a mercy from Allah. And Allah is All-Knowing, Wise."
"And whoso kills a believer intentionally, his reward shall be Hell wherein he shall abide. And Allah will be wroth with him and will curse him and will prepare for him a great punishment."
"O ye who believe! when you go forth in the cause of Allah, make proper investigation and say not to anyone who greets you with the greeting of peace, ‘Thou art not a believer.’ You seek the goods of this life, but with Allah are good things in plenty. Such were you before this, but Allah conferred His (special) favour on you; so do make proper investigation. Surely, Allah is well aware of what you do."
"Those of the believers who sit (still), excepting the disabled ones, and those who strive in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their persons, are not equal. Allah has exalted in rank those who strive with their wealth and their persons above those who sit (still). And to each Allah has promised good. And Allah has exalted those who strive above those who sit (still), by a great reward,"
"(Namely, by) degrees of excellence (bestowed) by Him, and (by special) forgiveness and mercy. And Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"Verily, those whom the angels cause to die while they are wronging their own souls, they (the angels) will say (to them): ‘What were you after?’ They will reply: ‘We were treated as weak in the land.’ They will say, ‘Was not Allah’s earth vast enough for you to emigrate therein?’ It is these whose abode shall be Hell, and an evil destination it is;"
"Except such weak ones among men, women and children, as are incapable of adopting any plan or of finding any way."
"As to these, maybe Allah will efface their sins; for Allah is the Effacer of sins, (and is) Most Forgiving."
"And whoso emigrates from his country in the cause of Allah will find in the earth an abundant place of refuge and plentifulness. And whoso goes forth from his home, emigrating in the cause of Allah and His Messenger, and death overtakes him, his reward lies on Allah, and Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"And when you journey in the land, it shall be no sin on you to shorten the Prayer, if you fear that those who disbelieve may give you trouble. Verily, the disbelievers are an open enemy to you."
"And when thou art among them, and leadest the Prayer for them, let a party of them stand with thee and let them take their arms. And when they have performed their prostrations, let them go to your rear, and let another party, who have not yet prayed, come forward and pray with thee; and let them take their means of defence and their arms. The disbelievers wish that you be neglectful of your arms and your baggage that they may fall upon you at once. And it shall be no sin on you, if you are in trouble on account of rain or if you are sick, that you lay aside your arms. But you should (always) take your means of defence. Surely, Allah has prepared an humiliating punishment for the disbelievers."
"And when you have finished the Prayer, remember Allah while standing, and sitting, and (lying) on your sides. And when you are secure (from danger), then observe Prayer (in the prescribed form); verily Prayer is enjoined on the believers (to be performed) at fixed hours."
"And slacken not in seeking these people. If you suffer, they too suffer even as you suffer. But you hope from Allah what they hope not. And Allah is All-Knowing, Wise."
"We have surely sent down to thee the Book comprising the truth, that thou mayest judge between men by that which Allah has taught thee. And be not thou a disputer for the faithless;"
"And ask forgiveness of Allah. Surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"And plead not on behalf of those who are dishonest to themselves. Surely, Allah loves not one who is perfidious (and) a great sinner."
"They seek to hide from men, but they cannot hide from Allah; and He is with them when they spend the night plotting about matters of which He does not approve. And Allah encompasses what they do."
"Behold! you are they who pleaded for them in the present life. But who will plead with Allah for them on the Day of Resurrection, or who will be a guardian over them?"
"And whoso does evil or wrongs his soul, and then asks forgiveness of Allah, will (surely) find Allah Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"And whoso commits a sin commits it only against his own soul. And Allah is All-Knowing, Wise."
"And whoso commits a fault or a sin, then imputes it to an innocent person, certainly bears (the burden of) a calumny and a manifest sin."
"And but for the grace of Allah upon thee and His mercy, a party of them had resolved to bring about thy ruin. And they ruin none but themselves and they cannot harm thee at all. Allah has sent down to thee the Book and Wisdom and has taught thee what thou knewest not, and great is Allah’s grace on thee."
"There is no good in many of their conferences except (the conferences of) such as enjoin charity, or goodness, or the making of peace among men. And whoso does that, seeking the pleasure of Allah, We shall soon bestow on him a great reward."
"And (as to) him who opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him, and follows a way other than that of the believers, We shall let him pursue the way he is pursuing and shall cast him into Hell; and an evil destination it is."
"Allah will not forgive that anything be associated with Him as partner, but He will forgive what is short of that to whomsoever He pleases. And whoso associates anything as partner with Allah has indeed strayed far away."
"They invoke beside Him none but lifeless objects; and they invoke none but Satan, the rebellious,"
"Whom Allah has cursed. And he said, ‘I will assuredly take a fixed portion from Thy servants;"
"‘And assuredly I will lead them astray and assuredly I will excite in them vain desires, and assuredly I will incite them and they will cut the ears of cattle; and assuredly I will incite them and they will alter Allah’s creation.’ And he who takes Satan for a friend beside Allah has certainly suffered a manifest loss."
"He holds out promises to them and raises vain desires in them, and Satan promises them nothing but vain things."
These are they whose abode shall be Hell and they shall find no way of escape from it.
"But (as to) those who believe and do good works, We will admit them into Gardens, beneath which streams flow, abiding therein for ever. (It is) Allah’s unfailing promise; and who can be more truthful than Allah in word?"
"It shall not be according to your desires, nor according to the desires of the People of the Book. Whoso does evil shall be rewarded for it; and he shall find for himself no friend or helper beside Allah."
"But whoso does good works, whether male or female, and is a believer, such shall enter Heaven, and shall not be wronged even (as much as) the little hollow in the back of a date-stone."
"And who is better in faith than he who submits himself to Allah, and he is a doer of good, and follows the religion of Abraham, the upright? And Allah took Abraham for a special friend."
And to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth; and Allah encompasses all things.
"And they seek of thee the decision (of the Law) with regard to women. Say, Allah gives you His decision regarding them. And so does that which is recited to you in the Book concerning the orphan girls whom you give not what is prescribed for them and whom you desire to marry, and (concerning) the weak among children. And (He enjoins you to) observe equity towards the orphans. And whatever good you do, surely Allah knows it well."
"And if a woman fear ill treatment or indifference on the part of her husband, it shall be no sin on them that they be suitably reconciled to each other; and reconciliation is best. And people are prone to covetousness. If you do good and are righteous, surely Allah is aware of what you do."
"And you cannot keep perfect balance between wives, however much you may desire it. But incline not wholly (to one) so that you leave the other like a thing suspended. And if you amend and act righteously, surely Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"And if they separate, Allah will make both independent out of His abundance; and Allah is Bountiful, Wise."
"And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. And We have assuredly commanded those who were given the Book before you, and (commanded) you also, to fear Allah. But if you disbelieve, then (remember that) to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and Allah is Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy."
"And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and sufficient is Allah as a Guardian."
"If He please, He can take you away, O people, and bring others (in your stead); and Allah has full power to do that."
"Whoso desires the reward of this world, then (let him remember that) with Allah is the reward of this world and of the next; and Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing."
"O ye who believe! be strict in observing justice, (and be) witnesses for Allah, even though it be against yourselves or (against) parents and kindred. Whether he be rich or poor, Allah is more regardful of them both (than you are). Therefore follow not low desires so that you may (be able to) act equitably. And if you conceal (the truth) or evade (it), then (remember that) Allah is well aware of what you do."
"O ye who believe! believe in Allah and His Messenger, and in the Book which He has revealed to His Messenger, and the Book which He revealed before (it). And whoso disbelieves in Allah and His angels, and His Books, and His Messengers, and the Last Day, has surely strayed far away."
"Those who believe, then disbelieve, then (again) believe, then disbelieve, (and) then increase in disbelief, Allah will never forgive them nor will He guide them to the way."
"Give to the hypocrites the tidings that for them is a grievous punishment,"
Those who take disbelievers for friends rather than believers. Do they seek honour at their hands? Then (let them remember that) all honour belongs to Allah.
"And He has already revealed to you in the Book that, when you hear the Signs of Allah being denied and mocked at, sit not with them until they engage in a talk other than that; for in that case you would be like them. Surely, Allah will assemble the hypocrites and the disbelievers in Hell, all together;"
"Those who wait (for news) concerning you. If you have a victory from Allah, they say, ‘Were we not with you?’ And if the disbelievers have a share (of it), they say (to them), ‘Did we not get the better of you, and protect you against the believers?’ Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection; and Allah will not grant the disbelievers a way (to prevail) against the believers."
"The hypocrites seek to deceive Allah, but He will punish them for their deception. And when they stand up for Prayer, they stand lazily (and) to be seen of men, and they remember Allah but little,"
"Wavering between (this and) that, (belonging) neither to these nor to those. And he whom Allah causes to perish, for him thou shalt not find a way."
"O ye who believe! take not disbelievers for friends, in preference to believers. Do you mean to give Allah a manifest proof against yourselves?"
"The hypocrites shall surely be in the lowest depth of the Fire; and thou shalt find no helper for them,"
Except those who repent and amend and hold fast to Allah and are sincere in their obedience to Allah. These are among the believers. And Allah will soon bestow a great reward upon the believers.
"Why should Allah punish you, if you are thankful and (if) you believe? And Allah is Appreciating, All-Knowing."
"Allah likes not the uttering of unseemly speech in public, except (on the part of) one who is (being) wronged. Verily, Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
"Whether you make public a good deed or conceal it, or pardon an evil, Allah is certainly the Effacer of sins, (and is) All-Powerful."
"Surely, those who disbelieve in Allah and His Messengers and desire to make a distinction between Allah and His Messengers, and say, ‘We believe in some and disbelieve in others,’ and desire to take a way in between,"
"These indeed are veritable disbelievers, and We have prepared for the disbelievers an humiliating punishment."
"And (as for) those who believe in Allah and (in all of) His Messengers and make no distinction between any of them, these are they whom He will soon give their rewards. And Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"The People of the Book ask thee to cause a Book to descend on them from heaven. They asked Moses a greater thing than this: they said, ‘Show us Allah openly.’ Then a destructive punishment overtook them because of their transgression. Then they took the calf (for worship) after clear Signs had come to them, but We pardoned (even) that. And We gave Moses manifest authority."
"And We raised high above them the Mount while making a covenant with them, and We said to them, ‘Enter the gate submissively,’ and We said to them, ‘Transgress not in (the matter of) the Sabbath.’ And We took from them a firm covenant."
"Then, because of their breaking of their covenant, and their denial of the Signs of Allah, and their seeking to kill the Prophets unjustly, and their saying: ‘Our hearts are wrapped in covers,’ — nay, but Allah has sealed them because of their disbelief, so they believe not but little — "
"And because of their disbelief and their uttering against Mary a grievous calumny,"
"And their saying, ‘We did kill the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah;’ whereas they slew him not, nor crucified him, but he was made to appear to them like (one crucified); and those who differ therein are certainly in (a state of) doubt about it; they have no (definite) knowledge thereof, but only follow a conjecture; and they did not convert this (conjecture) into a certainty;"
"On the contrary, Allah exalted him to Himself. And Allah is Mighty, Wise."
"And there is none among the People of the Book but will believe in it before his death; and on the Day of Resurrection, he (Jesus) shall be a witness against them — "
"So, because of the transgression of the Jews, We forbade them pure things which had been allowed to them, and (also) because of their hindering many (men) from Allah’s way,"
"And (because of) their taking interest, although they had been forbidden it, and (because of) their devouring people’s wealth wrongfully. And We have prepared for those of them who disbelieve a painful punishment."
"But those among them who are firmly grounded in knowledge, and the believers, believe in what has been sent down to thee and what was sent down before thee, and (especially) those who observe Prayer and those who pay the Zakat and those who believe in Allah and the Last Day. To these will We surely give a great reward."
"Surely, We have sent revelation to thee, as We sent revelation to Noah and the Prophets after him; and We sent revelation to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and (his) children and (to) Jesus and Job and Jonah and Aaron and Solomon, and We gave David a Book."
And (We sent some) Messengers whom We have already mentioned to thee and (some) Messengers whom We have not mentioned to thee — and Allah spoke to Moses particularly — 
"Messengers, bearers of glad tidings and warners, so that people may have no plea against Allah after (the coming of) the Messengers. And Allah is Mighty, Wise."
But Allah bears witness by means of (the revelation) which He has sent down to thee that He has sent it down (pregnant) with His knowledge; and the angels (also) bear witness; and sufficient is Allah as a Witness.
"Those who disbelieve and hinder (others) from the way of Allah, have certainly strayed far away."
"Surely, those who have disbelieved and have acted unjustly, Allah is not going to forgive them, nor will He show them any way,"
"Except the way of Hell, wherein they shall abide for a long, long period. And that is easy for Allah."
"O mankind, the Messenger has indeed come to you with Truth from your Lord; believe therefore, (it will be) better for you. But if you disbelieve, verily, to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and in the earth. And Allah is All-Knowing, Wise."
"O People of the Book, exceed not the limits in your religion, and say not of Allah anything but the truth. Verily, the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, was only a Messenger of Allah and (a fulfilment of) His word which He sent down to Mary, and a mercy from Him. So believe in Allah and His Messengers, and say not ‘(They are) three.’ Desist, (it will be) better for you. Verily, Allah is the only One God. Far is it from His Holiness that He should have a son. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. And sufficient is Allah as a Guardian."
"Surely, the Messiah will never disdain to be a servant of Allah, nor will the angels near (unto) God; and whoso disdains to worship Him and feels proud, He will gather them all to Himself."
"Then as for those who believed and did good works, He will give them their rewards in full and will give them more out of His bounty; but as for those who disdained and were proud, He will punish them with a painful punishment. And they shall find for themselves beside Allah no friend nor helper."
"O ye people, a manifest proof has indeed come to you from your Lord, and We have sent down to you a clear light."
"So, as for those who believe in Allah and hold fast to Him, He will surely admit them to His mercy and grace and will guide them on a straight path (leading) to Himself."
"They ask thee for instructions. Say, Allah gives you (His) instructions concerning ‘Kalalah’: If a man dies leaving no child and he has a sister, then she shall have half of what he leaves; and he shall inherit her if she has no child. But if there be two sisters, then they shall have two-thirds of what he leaves. And if (the heirs) be brethren — (both) men and women — then the male shall have as much as the portion of two females. Allah explains (this) to you lest you go astray, and Allah knows all things well."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"O ye who believe! fulfil (your) compacts. Lawful are made to you quadrupeds (of the class) of cattle other than those which are being announced to you, except that you should not hold game to be lawful while you are in a state of pilgrimage; verily, Allah decrees what He wills."
"O ye who believe! profane not the Signs of Allah, nor the Sacred Month, nor the animals brought as an offering, nor the (animals of sacrifice wearing) collars, nor those repairing to the Sacred House, seeking grace from their Lord, and (His) pleasure. And when you put off the pilgrims’ garb (and are clear of the Sacred Territory), you may hunt. And let not the enmity of a people, that they hindered you from the Sacred Mosque, incite you to transgress. And help one another in righteousness and piety; but help not one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allah; surely, Allah is severe in punishment."
"Forbidden to you is (the flesh of an animal) which dies of itself, and blood and the flesh of swine; and that on which is invoked the name of one other than Allah; and that which has been strangled; and that beaten to death; and that killed by a fall; and that which has been gored to death; and that of which a wild animal has eaten, except that which you have properly slaughtered; and that which has been slaughtered at an altar. (And forbidden is also) that you seek to know your lot by the divining arrows. That is (an act of) disobedience. This day have those who disbelieve despaired of (harming) your religion. So fear them not, but fear Me. This day have I perfected your religion for you and completed My favour upon you and have chosen for you Islam as religion. But whoso is forced by hunger, without being wilfully inclined to sin, then, surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"They ask thee what is made lawful for them. Say, ‘All good things have been made lawful for you; and what you have taught the beasts and birds of prey (to catch for you), training (them) for hunting (and) teaching them of what Allah has taught you. So eat of that which they catch for you, and pronounce thereon the name of Allah. And fear Allah. Surely, Allah is quick in reckoning.’"
"This day all good things have been made lawful for you. And the food of the People of the Book is lawful for you, and your food is lawful for them. And (lawful for you are) chaste believing women and chaste women from among those who were given the Book before you, when you give them their dowries, contracting valid marriage and not committing fornication nor taking secret paramours. And whoever rejects the faith, his work has doubtless come to naught, and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers."
"O ye who believe! when you stand up for Prayer, wash your faces, and your hands up to the elbows, and pass your (wet) hands over your heads, and (wash) your feet to the ankles. And if you be unclean, purify yourselves (by bathing). And if you are ill or (you are) on a journey (while unclean), or one of you comes from the privy or you have touched women, and you find not water, betake yourselves to pure dust and wipe therewith your faces and your hands. Allah desires not that He should place you in a difficulty, but He desires to purify you and to complete His favour upon you, so that you may be grateful."
"And remember Allah’s favour upon you and the covenant which He made with you, when you said, ‘We hear and we obey.’ And fear Allah. Surely, Allah knows well what is in the minds."
"O ye who believe! be steadfast in the cause of Allah, bearing witness in equity; and let not a people’s enmity incite you to act otherwise than with justice. Be (always) just, that is nearer to righteousness. And fear Allah. Surely, Allah is aware of what you do."
Allah has promised those who believe and do good deeds that they shall have forgiveness and a great reward.
"And (as for) those who disbelieve and reject Our Signs, they are the people of Hell."
"O ye who believe! remember Allah’s favour upon you when a people intended to stretch out their hands against you, but He withheld their hands from you; and fear Allah. And on Allah should the believers rely."
"And indeed Allah did take a covenant from the children of Israel; and We raised among them twelve leaders. And Allah said, ‘Surely, I am with you. If you observe Prayer, and pay the Zakat, and believe in My Messengers and support them, and lend to Allah a goodly loan, I will remove your evils from you and admit you into Gardens beneath which streams flow. But whoso from among you disbelieves thereafter does indeed stray away from the right path.’"
"So, because of their breaking their covenant, We have cursed them, and have hardened their hearts. They pervert the words from their (proper) places and have forgotten a (good) part of that with which they were exhorted. And thou wilt not cease to discover treachery on their part, except (in) a few of them. So pardon them and turn away (from them). Surely, Allah loves those who do good."
"And from those (also) who say, ‘We are Christians,’ We took a covenant, but they too have forgotten a (good) part of that with which they were exhorted. So We have caused enmity and hatred among them till the Day of Resurrection. And Allah will soon let them know what they have been doing."
O People of the Book! there has come to you Our Messenger who unfolds to you much of what you had kept hidden of the Book and passes over much. There has come to you indeed from Allah a Light and a clear Book.
"Thereby does Allah guide those who seek His pleasure on the paths of peace, and leads them out of every (kind of) darkness into light by His will, and guides them to the right path."
"They have indeed disbelieved who say, ‘Surely, Allah is none but the Messiah, son of Mary.’ Say, ‘Who then has any power against Allah, if He desire to bring to naught the Messiah, son of Mary, and his mother and all those that are in the earth?’ And to Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is between them. He creates what He pleases; and Allah has power to do all things."
"The Jews and the Christians say, ‘We are sons of Allah and His loved ones.’ Say, ‘Why then does He punish you for your sins? Nay, you are (only) human beings among those He has created.’ He forgives whom He pleases and punishes whom He pleases. And to Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, and to Him shall be the return."
"O People of the Book! there has come to you Our Messenger, after a break in (the series of) Messengers, who makes (things) clear to you lest you say, ‘There has come to us no bearer of glad tidings and no warner.’ So a bearer of glad tidings and a warner has indeed come to you. And Allah has power to do all things."
"And (remember) when Moses said to his people, ‘O my people, call to mind Allah’s favour upon you when He appointed Prophets among you and made you kings, and gave you what He gave not to any other among the peoples."
"‘O my people, enter the Holy Land which Allah has ordained for you and do not turn back, for then you will turn losers.’"
"They said, ‘O Moses, there is in that (land) a haughty and powerful people, and we shall not enter it until they go forth from it. But if they go forth from it, then we will enter (it).’"
"Thereupon two men from among those who feared (their Lord), on whom Allah had conferred His favour, said, ‘Enter the gate, (advancing) against them; when (once) you have entered it, then surely you will be victorious. And put your trust in Allah, if you are believers.’"
"They said, ‘O Moses, we will never enter it so long as they remain in it. Therefore, go thou and thy Lord and fight, (and) here we sit.’"
"He said, ‘My Lord, I have power over none but myself and my brother; therefore make Thou a distinction between us and the rebellious people.’"
"(God) said: ‘Verily, it shall be forbidden them for forty years; in distraction shall they wander through the land. So grieve not over the rebellious people.’"
"And relate to them truly the story of the two sons of Adam, when they (each) offered an offering, and it was accepted from one of them and was not accepted from the other. The latter said, ‘I will surely kill thee.’ The former replied, ‘Allah accepts only from the righteous."
"‘If thou stretch out thy hand against me to kill me, I am not going to stretch out my hand against thee to kill thee. I do fear Allah, the Lord of the universe."
"‘I wish that thou shouldst bear my sin as well as thy sin, and thus be among the inmates of the Fire, and that is the reward of those who do wrong.’"
"But his mind induced him to kill his brother, so he killed him and became one of the losers."
"Then Allah sent a raven which scratched in the ground, that He might show him how to hide the corpse of his brother. He said, ‘Woe is me! Am I not able to be even like this raven so that I may hide the corpse of my brother?’ And then he became regretful."
"On account of this, We prescribed for the children of Israel that whosoever killed a person — unless it be for (killing) a person or for creating disorder in the land — it shall be as if he had killed all mankind; and whoso gave life to one, it shall be as if he had given life to all mankind. And Our Messengers came to them with clear Signs, yet even after that, many of them commit excesses in the land."
"The reward of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive to create disorder in the land is (only this) that they be slain or crucified or their hands and their feet be cut off on alternate sides, or they be expelled from the land. That shall be a disgrace for them in this world, and in the Hereafter they shall have a great punishment;"
"Except those who repent before you have them in your power. So know that Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
O ye who believe! fear Allah and seek the way of approach unto Him and strive in His way that you may prosper.
"Surely, if those who disbelieve had all that is in the earth and as much over again, to ransom themselves therewith from the punishment of the Day of Resurrection, it would not be accepted from them; and they shall have a painful punishment."
"They will wish to come out of the Fire, but they will not be able to come out of it, and they shall have a lasting punishment."
"And (as for) the man who steals and the woman who steals, cut off their hands in retribution of their offence as an exemplary punishment from Allah. And Allah is Mighty, Wise."
"But whoso repents after his transgression and amends, then will Allah surely turn to him in mercy; verily, Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
Dost thou not know that Allah is He to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth? He punishes whom He pleases and forgives whom He pleases; and Allah has power to do all things.
"O Messenger! let not those grieve thee who hastily fall into disbelief — those who say with their mouths, ‘We believe,’ but their hearts believe not. And among the Jews (too) are those who would fondly listen to (any) lie — who listen for (conveying it to) another people who have not come to thee. They pervert words after their being put in their (right) places, and say, ‘If you are given this, then accept it, but if you are not given this, then beware!’ And as for him whom Allah desires to try, thou shalt not avail him aught against Allah. These are they whose hearts Allah has not been pleased to purify; they shall have disgrace in this world, and in the Hereafter they shall have a severe punishment."
"They are habitual listeners to falsehood, devourers of things forbidden. If, then, they come to thee (for judgment), judge between them or turn aside from them. And if thou turn aside from them, they cannot harm thee at all. And if thou judge, judge between them with justice. Surely, Allah loves those who are just."
"And how will they make thee (their) judge when they have with them the Torah, wherein is Allah’s judgment? Yet, in spite of that they turn their backs; and certainly they will not believe."
"Surely, We sent down the Torah wherein was guidance and light. By it did the Prophets, who were obedient (to Us), judge for the Jews, as did the godly people and those learned (in the Law); for they were required to preserve the Book of Allah, and (because) they were guardians over it. Therefore fear not men but fear Me; and barter not My Signs for a paltry price. And whoso judges not by that which Allah has sent down, these it is who are the disbelievers."
"And therein We prescribed for them: A life for a life, and an eye for an eye, and a nose for a nose, and an ear for an ear, and a tooth for a tooth, and for (other) injuries equitable retaliation. And whoso waives the right thereto, it shall be an expiation for his (sins); and whoso judges not by what Allah has sent down, these it is who are wrongdoers."
"And We caused Jesus, son of Mary, to follow in their footsteps, fulfilling that which was (revealed) before him in the Torah; and We gave him the Gospel which contained guidance and light, fulfilling that which was (revealed) before it in the Torah, and a guidance and an admonition for the God-fearing."
"And let the People of the Gospel judge according to what Allah has revealed therein, and whoso judges not by what Allah has revealed, these it is who are the rebellious."
"And We have revealed unto thee the Book comprising the truth (and) fulfilling that which was (revealed) before it in the Book, and as a guardian over it. Judge, therefore, between them by what Allah has revealed, and follow not their evil inclinations, (turning away) from the truth which has come to thee. For each of you We prescribed a clear spiritual Law and a manifest way (in secular matters). And if Allah had (enforced) His will, He would have made you (all) one people, but (He wishes) to try you by that which He has given you. Vie, then, with one another in good works. To Allah shall you all return; then will He inform you of that wherein you differed."
"And (We have revealed the Book to thee bidding thee) to judge between them by that which Allah has revealed and not to follow their evil inclinations, and to be on thy guard against them, lest they cause thee (to fall into) affliction on account of part of what Allah has revealed to thee. But if they turn away, then know that Allah intends to smite them for some of their sins. And indeed a large number of men are disobedient."
Do they then seek the judgment of (the days of) Ignorance? And who is better than Allah as a Judge for a people who have firm faith?
"O ye who believe! take not the Jews and the Christians for friends. They are friends one to another. And whoso among you takes them for friends is indeed one of them. Verily, Allah guides not the unjust people."
"And thou wilt see those in whose hearts is a disease, hastening towards them, saying, ‘We fear lest a misfortune befall us.’ Maybe, Allah will bring about victory or some (other) event from Himself. Then will they become regretful of what they concealed in their minds."
"And those who believe will say, ‘Are these they who swore by Allah with their most solemn oaths that they were surely with you?’ Their works are vain and they have become the losers."
"O ye who believe! whoso among you turns back from his religion, then (let it be known that in his stead) Allah will soon bring a people whom He will love and who will love Him, (and who will be) kind and humble towards believers, hard and firm against disbelievers. They will strive in the cause of Allah and will not fear the reproach of a faultfinder. That is Allah’s grace; He bestows it upon whomsoever He pleases; and Allah is Bountiful, All- Knowing."
Your friend is only Allah and His Messenger and the believers who observe Prayer and pay the Zakat and worship God alone.
And those who take Allah and His Messenger and the believers for friends (should rest assured) that it is the party of Allah that must triumph.
"O ye who believe! take not those for friends who make a jest and sport of your religion from among those who were given the Book before you, and the disbelievers. And fear Allah if you are believers;"
"And (who), when you call (people) to Prayer, take it as jest and sport. That is because they are a people who do not understand."
"Say, ‘O People of the Book! do you find fault with us because we believe in Allah and what has been sent down to us and what was sent down previously? Or (is it) because most of you are disobedient (to God)?’"
"Say, ‘Shall I inform you of those whose reward with Allah is worse than that? (They are) those whom Allah has cursed and on whom His wrath has fallen and of whom He has made apes and swine and (who) worship the Evil One. These indeed are in a worse plight, and farther astray from the right path."
"And when they come to you, they say, ‘We believe,’ while they enter with unbelief and go out therewith; and Allah knows best what they conceal."
And thou seest many of them hastening towards sin and transgression and the eating of things forbidden. Evil indeed is that which they practise.
Why do not the divines and those learned in the Law prohibit them from uttering falsehood and eating things forbidden? Evil indeed is that which they do.
"And the Jews say, ‘The hand of Allah is tied up.’ Their (own) hands shall be tied up and they shall be cursed for what they say. Nay, both His hands are wide open; He spends how He pleases. And what has been sent down to thee from thy Lord will most surely increase many of them in rebellion and disbelief. And We have cast among them enmity and hatred till the Day of Resurrection. Whenever they kindle a fire for war, Allah extinguishes it. And they strive to create disorder in the earth, and Allah loves not those who create disorder."
"And if the People of the Book had believed and been righteous, We would surely have removed from them their evils and We would surely have admitted them into Gardens of Bliss."
"And if they had observed the Torah and the Gospel and what has been (now) sent down to them from their Lord, they would, surely, have eaten (of good things) from above them and from under their feet. Among them are a people who are moderate; but many of them — evil indeed is that which they do."
"O Messenger! convey (to the people) what has been revealed to thee from thy Lord; and if thou do it not, thou hast not conveyed His Message (at all). And Allah will protect thee from men. Surely, Allah guides not the disbelieving people."
"Say, ‘O People of the Book! you (stand) on nothing until you observe the Torah and the Gospel and what has (now) been sent down to you from your Lord.’ And surely, what has been sent down to thee from thy Lord will increase many of them in rebellion and disbelief; so grieve not for the disbelieving people."
"Surely, those who have believed, and the Jews, and the Sabians, and the Christians — whoso believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good deeds, on them (shall come) no fear, nor shall they grieve."
"Surely, We took a covenant from the children of Israel, and We sent Messengers to them. But every time there came to them a Messenger with what their hearts desired not, they treated some as liars, and some they sought to kill."
"And they thought there would be no punishment, so they became blind and deaf. But Allah turned to them in mercy; yet again many of them became blind and deaf; and Allah is Watchful of what they do."
"Indeed they are disbelievers who say, ‘Surely, Allah is none but the Messiah, son of Mary,’ whereas the Messiah (himself) said, ‘O children of Israel, worship Allah Who is my Lord and your Lord.’ Surely, whoso associates partners with Allah, him has Allah forbidden Heaven, and the Fire will be his resort. And the wrongdoers shall have no helpers."
"They are surely disbelievers who say, ‘Allah is the third of three;’ there is no God but the One God. And if they do not desist from what they say, a grievous punishment shall surely befall those of them that disbelieve."
"Will they not then turn to Allah and beg His forgiveness, while Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful?"
"The Messiah, son of Mary, was only a Messenger; surely, Messengers (like unto him) had indeed passed away before him. And his mother was a truthful woman. They both used to eat food. See how We explain the Signs for their good, and see how they are turned away."
"Say, ‘Will you worship beside Allah that which has no power to do you harm or good?’ And it is Allah Who is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
"Say, ‘O People of the Book! exceed not the limits in (the matter of) your religion unjustly, nor follow the evil inclinations of a people who went astray before and caused many to go astray, and (who) have strayed away from the right path.’"
"Those amongst the children of Israel who disbelieved were cursed by the tongue of David, and of Jesus, son of Mary. That was because they disobeyed and used to transgress."
They did not prohibit one another from the iniquity which they committed. Evil indeed was that which they used to do.
"Thou shalt see many of them taking the disbelievers as (their) friends. Surely, evil is that which they themselves have sent on before for themselves; (with the result) that Allah is displeased with them; and in (this) punishment they shall abide."
"And if they had believed in Allah and this Prophet, and (in) that which has been revealed to him, they would not have taken them as (their) friends, but many of them are disobedient."
"Thou shalt certainly find the Jews and those who associate partners (with God) to be the most vehement of men in enmity against the believers. And thou shalt assuredly find those who say, ‘We are Christians,’ to be the nearest of them in love to the believers. That is because amongst them are savants and monks and because they are not proud."
"And when they hear what has been revealed to this Messenger, thou seest their eyes overflow with tears, because of the truth which they have recognized. They say, ‘Our Lord, we believe, so write us down among those who bear witness."
"‘And why should we not believe in Allah and in the truth which has come to us, while we earnestly wish that our Lord should include us among the righteous people?’"
"So Allah rewarded them, for what they said, with Gardens beneath which streams flow. Therein shall they abide; and that is the reward of those who do good."
"And those who have disbelieved and rejected Our Signs, these are they who are the inmates of Hell."
"O ye who believe! make not unlawful the good things which Allah has made lawful for you, and do not transgress. Surely, Allah loves not the transgressors."
And eat of that which Allah has provided for you of what is lawful and good. And fear Allah in Whom you believe.
"Allah will not call you to account for (such of) your oaths as are vain, but He will call you to account for the oaths which you take in earnest. The expiation for this is the feeding of ten poor persons with (such) average (food) as you feed your families with, or the clothing of them or the freeing of a neck. But whoso finds not (the means) shall fast for three days. That is the expiation of your oaths when you have sworn (them.) And do keep your oaths. Thus does Allah explain to you His Signs that you may be grateful."
O ye who believe! wine and the game of hazard and idols and divining arrows are only an abomination of Satan’s handiwork. So shun (each one of) them that you may prosper.
"Satan desires only to create enmity and hatred among you by means of wine and the game of hazard, and to keep you back from the remembrance of Allah and from  Prayer. But will you keep back?"
"And obey Allah and obey the Messenger, and be on (your) guard. But if you turn away, then know that on Our Messenger lies only the clear conveyance of the Message."
"On those who believe and do good works there shall be no sin for what they eat, provided they fear (God) and believe and do good works, (and) again fear (God) and believe, yet again fear (God) and do good. And Allah loves those who do good."
"O ye who believe! Allah will surely try you in a (little) matter: the game which your hands and your lances can reach, so that Allah may distinguish those who fear Him in secret. Whoso, therefore, will transgress after this shall have a grievous punishment."
"O ye who believe! kill not game while you are in a state of pilgrimage. And whoso amongst you kills it intentionally, its compensation is a quadruped like unto that which he has killed, as determined by two just men from among you, (the same) to be brought as an offering to the Ka‘bah; or as an expiation (he shall have) to feed (a number of) poor persons, or fast an equivalent number (of days), so that he may taste the penalty of his deed. (As for) the past, Allah forgives (it); but whoso reverts to it, Allah will punish him (for his offence). And Allah is Mighty, Lord of retribution."
The game of the sea and the eating thereof have been made lawful for you as a provision for you and the travellers; but forbidden to you is the game of the land as long as you are in a state of pilgrimage. And fear Allah to Whom you shall be gathered.
"Allah has made the Ka‘bah, the inviolable House, as a means of support and uplift for mankind, as also the Sacred Month and the offerings and the (animals with) collars. That is so that you may know that Allah knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth, and that Allah knows all things well."
"Know that Allah is severe in punishment and that Allah is (also) Most Forgiving, Merciful."
On the Messenger lies only the conveying of the Message. And Allah knows what you reveal and what you hide.
"Say, ‘The bad and the good are not alike,’ even though the abundance of the bad may cause thee to wonder. So fear Allah, O men of understanding, that you may prosper."
"O ye who believe! ask not about things which, if revealed to you, would cause you trouble; though if you ask about them while the Qur’an is being sent down, they will be revealed to you. Allah has left them out. And Allah is Most Forgiving, Forbearing."
"A people before you asked about such (things), (but) then they became disbelievers therein."
"Allah has not ordained any ‘Bahirah’ or ‘Sa’ibah’ or ‘Wasilah’ or ‘Hami’; but those who disbelieve forge a lie against Allah, and most of them do not make use of their understanding."
"And when it is said to them, ‘Come to what Allah has revealed, and to the Messenger,’ they say, ‘Sufficient for us is that wherein we found our fathers.’ What! even though their fathers had no knowledge and no guidance?"
O ye who believe! be heedful of your own selves. He who goes astray cannot harm you when you (yourselves) are rightly guided. To Allah will you all return; then will He disclose to you what you used to do.
"O ye who believe! the (right) evidence among you, when death presents itself to one of you, at the time of making a bequest, is of two just men from among you; or of two others not from among you, if you be journeying in the land and the calamity of death befall you. You shall detain them both after Prayer (for giving evidence); if you doubt, they shall both swear by Allah, (saying), ‘We take not in exchange for this any price, even though he be a near relation, and we conceal not the testimony (enjoined) by Allah; surely, in that case, we should be among the sinners.’"
"But if it be discovered that the two (witnesses) are guilty of sin, then two others shall take their place from among those against whom the (former) two (witnesses —) who were in a better position (to give true evidence —  sinfully) deposed, and the two (latter witnesses) shall swear by Allah, (saying), ‘Surely, our testimony is truer than the testimony of the (former) two, and we have not been unfair (in any way); for then, indeed, we should be of the unjust.’"
Thus it is more likely that they will give evidence according to facts or that they will fear that other oaths will be taken after their oaths. And fear Allah and hearken. And Allah guides not the disobedient people.
" (Think of) the day when Allah will assemble the Messengers and say, ‘What reply was made to you?’ They will say, ‘We have no knowledge, it is only Thou Who art the Knower of hidden things.’"
"When Allah will say, “O Jesus, son of Mary, remember My favour upon thee and upon thy mother; when I strengthened thee with the Spirit of holiness (so that) thou didst speak to the people in the cradle and in middle age; and when I taught thee the Book and Wisdom and the  Torah and the Gospel; and when thou didst fashion (a creation) out of clay, in the likeness of a bird, by My command; then thou didst breathe into it (a new spirit) and it became a soaring being by My command; and thou didst heal the night-blind and the leprous by My command; and when thou didst raise the dead by My command; and when I restrained the children of Israel from (putting) thee (to death) when thou didst come to them with clear Signs; and those who disbelieved from among them said, ‘This is nothing but clear deception.’”"
"And when I inspired the disciples (of Jesus) to believe in Me and in My Messenger, they said, ‘We believe and bear Thou witness that we have submitted.’"
"When the disciples said, ‘O Jesus, son of Mary, is thy Lord able to send down to us a table spread with food from heaven?’ he said, ‘Fear Allah, if you are believers.’"
"They said, ‘We desire that we may eat of it, and that our hearts be at rest and that we may know that thou hast spoken truth to us, and that we may be witnesses thereto.’"
"Said Jesus, son of Mary, ‘O Allah, our Lord, send down to us a table from heaven spread with food that it may be to us a festival, to the first of us and to the last of us, and a Sign from Thee; and provide sustenance for us, for Thou art the Best of sustainers.’"
"Allah said, ‘Surely, I will send it down to you, but whosoever of you disbelieves afterwards — I will surely punish them with a punishment wherewith I will not punish any other of the peoples.’"
"And when Allah will say, “O Jesus, son of Mary, didst thou say to men, ‘Take me and my mother for two gods beside Allah?’”, he will answer, “Holy art Thou. I could never say that to which I had no right. If I had said it, Thou wouldst have surely known it. Thou knowest what is in my mind, and I know not what is in Thy mind. It is only Thou Who art the Knower of hidden things."
"“I said nothing to them except that which Thou didst command me — ‘Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.’ And I was a witness over them as long as I remained among them, but since Thou didst cause me to die, Thou hast been the Watcher over them; and Thou art Witness over all things."
"“If Thou punish them, they are Thy servants; and if Thou forgive them, Thou surely art the Mighty, the Wise.”"
"Allah will say, ‘This is a day when (only) the truthful shall profit by their truthfulness. For them are Gardens beneath which streams flow; therein shall they abide for ever. Allah is well pleased with them, and they are well pleased with Him; that indeed is the great triumph.’"
To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatever is in them; and He has power over all things.
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
All praise belongs to Allah Who created the heavens and the earth and brought into being every (kind of) darkness and light; yet those who disbelieve set up equals to their Lord.
"He it is Who created you from clay, and then He decreed a term. And there is (another) term fixed with Him. Yet you doubt!"
"And He is Allah, (the God), (both) in the heavens and in the earth. He knows your inside and your outside. And He knows what you earn."
"And there comes not to them any Sign of the Signs of their Lord, but they turn away from it."
So they rejected the truth when it came to them; but soon shall come to them the tidings of that at which they mocked.
"See they not how many a generation We have destroyed before them? We had established them in the earth as We have established you not, and We sent the clouds over them, pouring down abundant rain; and We caused streams to flow beneath them; then did We destroy them because of their sins and raised up after them another generation."
"And if We had sent down to thee a writing upon parchment and they had felt it with their hands, (even then) the disbelievers would have surely said, ‘This is nothing but manifest sorcery.’"
"And they say, ‘Why has not an angel been sent down to him?’ But if We had sent down an angel, the matter would have been settled, (and) then they would not have been granted a respite."
"And if We had appointed (as Messenger) an angel, We would have made him (appear as) a man; and (thus) We would have made confused to them what they are (themselves) confusing."
"And surely have the Messengers been mocked at before thee, but that which they mocked at encompassed those of them who scoffed."
"Say, ‘Go about in the earth, and see what was the end of those who treated (the Prophets) as liars.’"
"Say, ‘To whom belongs what is in the heavens and the earth?’ Say, ‘To Allah.’ He has taken upon Himself (to show) mercy. He will certainly (continue to) assemble you till the Day of Resurrection. There is no doubt in it. Those who ruin their souls will not believe."
"To Him belongs whatever dwells in the night and the day. And He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing."
"Say, ‘Shall I take any protector other than Allah, the Maker of the heavens and the earth, Who feeds and is not fed?’ Say, ‘I have been commanded to be the first of those who submit.’ And be thou not of  those who associate partners (with God.)"
"Say, ‘Of a truth, I fear, if I disobey my Lord, the punishment of an awful day.’"
"He from whom it is averted on that day, (God) indeed has had mercy on him. And that indeed is a manifest triumph."
"And if Allah touch thee with affliction, there is none that can remove it but He; and if He touch thee with happiness, then He has power to do all that He wills."
"And He is Supreme over His servants; and He is the Wise, the All-Aware."
"Say, ‘What thing is most weighty as a witness?’ Say, ‘Allah is a Witness between me and you. And this Qur’an has been revealed to me so that with it I may warn you and whomsoever it reaches. What! do you really bear witness that there are other gods beside Allah?’ Say, ‘I bear not witness (thereto).’ Say, ‘He is the One God, and certainly I am far removed from that which you associate (with Him).’"
Those to whom We gave the Book recognize him as they recognize their sons. But those who ruin their souls will not believe.
"And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah or gives the lie to His Signs? Surely, the unjust shall not prosper."
"And (think of) the day when We shall gather them all together; then shall We say to those who associated partners (with God), ‘Where are the partners you spoke of, those whom you used to assert?’"
"Then (the end of) their mischief will be naught save that they shall say, ‘By Allah, our Lord, we were not idolaters.’"
See how they lie against themselves. And that which they fabricated has failed them.
"And among them are some who give ear to thee; but We have put veils on their hearts, that they should not understand, and deafness in their ears. And (even) if they see every Sign, they would not believe therein, so much so, that when they come to thee, disputing with thee, those who disbelieve say, ‘This is nothing but fables of the ancients.’"
And they forbid (others) to (believe) it and (themselves too) they keep away from it. And they ruin none but their own selves; only they perceive not.
"And if thou couldst only see when they are made to stand before the Fire! They will say, ‘Oh, would that we might be sent back! And (then) we would not treat the Signs of our Lord as lies, and we would be of the believers.’"
"Nay, that which they used to conceal before has (now) become clear to them. And if they were sent back, they would surely return to that which they were forbidden. And they are certainly liars."
"And they say, ‘There is nothing except (this) our present life, and we shall not be raised again.’"
"And if thou couldst only see when they are made to stand before their Lord! He will say, ‘Is not this (second life) the truth?’ They will say, ‘Yea, by our Lord.’ He will say, ‘Then taste the punishment because you disbelieved.’"
"Those indeed are the losers who deny the meeting with Allah, so much so, that when the Hour shall come on them unawares, they will say, ‘O our grief for our neglecting this (Hour)!’ And they shall bear their burdens on their backs. Surely, evil is that which they bear."
And worldly life is nothing but a sport and a pastime. And surely the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who are righteous. Will you not then understand?
We know (full well) that what they say verily grieves thee; for surely it is not thee that they charge with falsehood but it is the Signs of Allah that the evil-doers reject.
And Messengers indeed have been rejected before thee; but notwithstanding their rejection and persecution they remained patient until Our help came to them. There is none that can change the words of Allah. And there have already come to thee tidings of (past) Messengers.
"And if their aversion is grievous to thee, then, if thou art able to seek a passage into the earth or a ladder unto heaven, and bring them a Sign, (thou canst do so). And had Allah (enforced) His will, He could surely have brought them together into the guidance. So be thou not of those who lack knowledge."
"Only those can accept who listen. And (as for) the dead, Allah will raise them (to life,) then to Him shall they be brought back."
"And they say, ‘Why has not a Sign been sent down to him from his Lord?’ Say, ‘Surely, Allah has power to send down a Sign, but most of them do not know.’"
"There is not an animal (that crawls) in the earth, nor a bird that flies on its two wings, but they are communities like you. We have left out nothing in the Book. Then to their Lord shall they be gathered together."
"Those who have rejected Our Signs are deaf and dumb, in utter darkness. Whom Allah wills He allows to perish and whom He wills He places on the right path."
"Say, ‘What think ye? If the punishment of Allah come upon you or there come upon you the Hour, will you call upon any other than Allah, if you are truthful?’"
"Nay, but on Him alone will you call; then will He remove that which you call on Him (to remove), if He please, and you will forget what you associate (with Him.)"
And indeed We sent (Messengers) to peoples before thee; then We afflicted them with poverty and adversity that they might humble themselves.
"Why, then, when Our punishment came upon them, did they not grow humble? But their hearts were hardened and Satan made all that they did (seem) fair to them."
"Then, when they forgot that with which they had been admonished, We opened unto them the gates of all things, until, when they became exultant at what they were given, We seized them suddenly, and lo! they were plunged into despair."
"So the last remnant of the people who did wrong was cut off; and all praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds."
"Say, ‘What think ye? If Allah should take away your hearing and your sight, and seal up your hearts, who is the God other than Allah who could bring it (back) to you?’ See how We vary the Signs, yet they turn away."
"Say, ‘What think ye? If the punishment of Allah come upon you suddenly or openly, will any be destroyed save the wrongdoing people?’"
"And We send not the Messengers but as bearers of glad tidings and as warners. So those who believe and reform (themselves), on them (shall come) no fear nor shall they grieve."
"And those who reject Our Signs, punishment will touch them, because they disobeyed."
"Say: “I do not say to you: ‘I possess the treasures of Allah,’ nor do I know the unseen; nor do I say to you: ‘I am an angel.’ I follow only that which is revealed to me.” Say:  ‘Can a blind man and one who sees be alike?’ Will you not then reflect?"
"And warn thereby those who fear that they shall be gathered to their Lord, that they shall have no friend nor intercessor beside Him, so that they may become righteous."
"And drive not away those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, seeking His countenance. Thou art not at all accountable for them nor are they at all accountable for thee, that thou shouldst drive them away and be of the unjust."
"And in like manner have We tried some of them by others, that they may say, ‘Is it these whom Allah has favoured from among us?’ Does not Allah know best those who are grateful?"
"And when those who believe in Our Signs come to thee, say: ‘Peace be unto you! Your Lord has taken it upon Himself (to show) mercy, so that whoso among you does evil ignorantly, and repents thereafter and amends, then He is Most Forgiving, Merciful.’"
And thus do We expound the Signs (that you may seek forgiveness) and that the way of the sinners may become manifest.
"Say: ‘I am forbidden to worship those on whom you call beside Allah.’ Say: ‘I will not follow your evil inclinations. In that case, I shall become lost and I shall not be of the guided.’"
"Say: ‘I (take my stand) on a clear evidence from my Lord and you reject it. That which you desire to be hastened  is not in my (power). The decision rests with none but Allah. He explains the truth, and He is Best of judges.’"
"Say: ‘If that which you desire to be hastened were in my (power,) surely the matter would be decided between me and you. And Allah knows best the unjust.’"
"And with Him are the keys of the unseen; none knows them but He. And He knows whatsoever is in the land and (in) the sea. And there falls not a leaf but He knows it; nor is there a grain in the deep darkness of the earth, nor anything green or dry, but is (recorded) in a clear Book."
"And He it is Who takes your souls by night and knows that which you do by day; then He raises you up again therein, that the appointed term may be completed. Then to Him is your return. Then will He inform you of what you used to do."
"And He is Supreme over His servants, and He sends guardians (to watch) over you, until, when death comes to anyone of you, Our messengers take his soul, and they fail not."
"Then are they returned to Allah, their true Lord. Surely, His is the judgment. And He is the Quickest of reckoners."
"Say, “Who delivers you from the calamities of the land and the sea, (when) you call upon Him in humility and in secret, (saying), ‘If He deliver us from this, we will surely be of those who are grateful?’ ”"
"Say, ‘Allah delivers you from them and from every distress, yet you associate partners (with Him).’"
"Say, ‘He has power to send punishment upon you from above you or from beneath your feet, or to confound you by (splitting you into) sects and make you taste the violence of one another.’ See how We expound the Signs in various ways that they may understand!"
"And thy people have rejected it, though it is the truth. Say, ‘I am not a guardian over you.’"
For every prophecy there is a fixed time; and soon will you come to know.
"And when thou seest those who engage in (vain discourse concerning) Our Signs, then turn thou away from them until they engage in a discourse other than that. And if Satan cause thee to forget, then sit not, after recollection, with the unjust people."
"And those who are righteous are not at all accountable for them, but (their duty is) to admonish them, that they may fear (God.)"
"And let alone those who take their religion for a sport and a pastime, and whom worldly life has beguiled. And admonish (people) thereby lest a soul be consigned to perdition for what it has wrought. It shall have no helper nor intercessor beside Allah; and even if it offer every ransom, it shall not be accepted from it. These are they who have been delivered over to destruction for their own acts. They will have a drink of boiling water and a grievous punishment, because they disbelieved."
"Say: “Shall we call, beside Allah, upon that which can neither profit us nor harm us, and shall we be turned back on our heels after Allah has guided us, like one whom the evil ones entice away (leaving him) bewildered in the land, (and) who has companions who call him to guidance, (saying), ‘Come to us?’ ” Say: “Surely, the guidance of Allah is the only guidance and we have been commanded to submit to the Lord of all the worlds."
“And (we have been given the command): ‘Observe Prayer and fear Him;’ and He it is to Whom you shall be gathered.”
"And He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in accordance with the requirements of wisdom; and the day He says, ‘Be!’, it will be. His word is the truth, and His will be the kingdom on the day when the trumpet will be blown. (He is) the Knower of the unseen and the seen. And He is the Wise, the All-Aware."
"And (remember the time) when Abraham said to his father, Azar: ‘Dost thou take idols for gods? Surely, I see thee and thy people in manifest error.’"
And thus did We show Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth (that he might be rightly guided) and that he might be of those who have certainty of faith.
"And when the night darkened upon him, he saw a star. He said: ‘This is my Lord!’ But when it set, he said: ‘I like not those that set.’"
"And when he saw the moon rise with spreading light, he said: ‘This is my Lord.’ But when it set, he said, ‘If my Lord guide me not, I shall surely be of the people who go astray.’"
"And when he saw the sun rise with spreading light, he said: ‘This is my Lord, this is the greatest.’ But when it set, he said, ‘O my people, surely I am clear of that which you associate (with God)."
"‘I have turned my face toward Him Who created the heavens and the earth, being ever inclined (to God), and I am not of those who associate gods (with God).’"
"And his people argued with him. He said: ‘Do you argue with me concerning Allah when He has guided me aright? And I fear not that which you associate with Him, unless my Lord will something. My Lord comprehends all things in His knowledge. Will you not then be admonished?"
"‘And why should I fear that which you associate (with God), when you fear not to associate with Allah that for which He has sent down to you no authority?’ Which, then, of the two parties has greater right to security, if indeed you know?"
"Those who believe and mix not up their belief with injustice — it is they who shall have peace, and who are rightly guided."
"And that is Our argument which We gave to Abraham against his people. We exalt in degrees of rank whomso We please. Thy Lord is indeed Wise, All-Knowing."
"And We gave him Isaac and Jacob; each did We guide aright, and Noah did We guide aright aforetime, and of his progeny, David and Solomon and Job and Joseph and Moses and Aaron. Thus do We reward those who do good."
And (We guided) Zachariah and John and Jesus and Elias; each (one of them) was of the virtuous.
And (We also guided) Ishmael and Elisha and Jonah and Lot; and each one did We exalt above the people.
"And (We exalted) some of their fathers and their children and their brethren, and We chose them and We guided them in the straight path."
"That is the guidance of Allah. He guides thereby those of His servants whom He pleases. And if they had worshipped aught beside Him, surely all they did would have been of no avail to them."
"It is these to whom We gave the Book and dominion and prophethood. But if these (people) are ungrateful for them, (it matters not), for We have now entrusted them to a people who are not ungrateful for them."
"These it is whom Allah guided aright, so follow thou their guidance. Say: ‘I ask not of you any reward for it. This is naught but an admonition for all mankind.’"
"And they do not make a just estimate of Allah, when they say: ‘Allah has not revealed anything to any man.’ Say: ‘Who revealed the Book which Moses brought, a light and guidance for the people —  though you treat it as scraps of paper  which you show while you conceal much; and you have been taught that which neither you nor your fathers knew?’ — Say: ‘Allah’. Then leave them to amuse themselves with their (vain) discourse."
"And this is a Book which We have revealed, full of blessings, to fulfil that which preceded it, and to enable thee to warn the Mother of towns and those around her. And those who believe in the Hereafter believe therein and they keep a watch over their Prayer."
"And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah, or says, ‘It has been revealed to me,’ while nothing has been revealed to him; and who says, ‘I will send down the like of that which Allah has sent down?’ And if thou couldst only see, when the wrongdoers are in the agonies of death, and the angels stretch forth their hands, (saying), ‘Yield up your souls. This day shall you be awarded the punishment of disgrace, because of that which you spoke against Allah falsely and (because) you turned away from His Signs with disdain.’"
"And now you come to Us one by one even as We created you at first, and you have left behind you that which We bestowed upon you, and We see not with you your intercessors of whom you asserted that they were partners (with God) in your (affairs). Now you have been cut off from one another and that which you presumed has failed you."
"Verily, it is Allah Who causes the grain and the date-stones to sprout. He brings forth the living from the dead, and (He) is the Bringer forth of the dead from the living. That is Allah; wherefore, then, are you turned back?"
"He causes the break of day; and He made the night for rest and the sun and the moon for reckoning (time.) That is the decree of the Mighty, the Wise."
And He it is Who has made the stars for you that you may follow the right direction with their help amid the deep darkness of the land and the sea. We have explained the Signs in detail for a people who possess knowledge.
And He it is Who has produced you from a single person and there is (for you) a home and a lodging. We have explained the Signs in detail for a people who understand.
"And it is He Who sends down water from the cloud; and We bring forth therewith every kind of growth; then We bring forth with that green foliage wherefrom We produce clustered grain. And from the date-palm, out of its sheaths, (come forth) bunches hanging low. And (We produce therewith) gardens of grapes, and the olive and the pomegranate — similar and dissimilar. Look at the fruit thereof when it bears fruit, and the ripening thereof. Surely, in this are Signs for a people who believe."
"And they hold the Jinn to be partners with Allah, although He created them; and they falsely ascribe to Him sons and daughters without any knowledge. Holy is He and exalted (far) above what they attribute (to Him)!"
"The Originator of the heavens and the earth! How can He have a son when He has no consort, and (when) He has created everything and has knowledge of all things?"
"Such is Allah, your Lord. There is no God but He, the Creator of all things, so worship Him. And He is Guardian over everything."
"Eyes cannot reach Him but He reaches the eyes. And He is the Incomprehensible, the All-Aware."
"Proofs have indeed come to you from your Lord; so whoever sees, it is for his own good; and whoever becomes blind, it is to his own harm. And I am not a guardian over you."
"And thus do We vary the Signs (that the truth may become established), but (the result is) that they say, ‘Thou hast learnt (well);’ and (We vary the Signs) that We may explain it to a people who have knowledge."
Follow that which has been revealed to thee from thy Lord; there is no God but He; and turn aside from the idolaters.
"And if Allah had (enforced) His will, they would not have set up gods (with Him.) And We have not made thee a keeper over them nor art thou over them a guardian."
"And revile not those whom they call upon beside Allah, lest they, out of spite, revile Allah in (their) ignorance. Thus unto every people have We caused their doing (to seem) fair. Then unto their Lord is their return; and He will inform them of what they used to do."
"And they swear their strongest oaths by Allah that if there came to them a Sign, they would surely believe therein. Say, ‘Surely, Signs are with Allah. But what should make you understand that when the Signs come, they will not believe?’"
"And We shall confound their hearts and their eyes, as they believed not therein at the first time, and We shall leave them in their transgression to wander in distraction."
"And even if We send down unto them angels, and the dead speak to them, and We gather to them all things face to face, they would not believe, unless Allah (enforced) His will. But most of them behave ignorantly."
"And in like manner have We made for every Prophet an enemy, evil ones from among men and Jinn. They suggest one to another gilded speech in order to deceive — and if thy Lord had (enforced) His will, they would not have done it; so leave them alone with that which they fabricate — "
And in order that the hearts of those who believe not in the Hereafter may incline thereto and that they may be pleased therewith and that they may (continue to) earn what they are earning.
"Shall I seek for judge other than Allah, when He it is Who has sent down to you the Book, clearly explained? And those to whom We gave the Book know that it has been sent down from thy Lord with truth; so be thou not of those who doubt."
"And the word of thy Lord has been fulfilled in truth and justice. None can change His words; and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing."
"And if thou obey the majority of those on earth, they will lead thee astray from Allah’s way. They follow nothing but (mere) conjecture, and they do nothing but lie."
"Surely, thy Lord knows best those who go astray from His way; and He knows best those who are rightly guided."
"Eat, then, of that over which the name of Allah has been pronounced, if you are believers in His Signs."
"And what reason have you that you should not eat of that over which the name of Allah has been pronounced, when He has already explained to you that which He has forbidden unto you — save that which you are forced to? And surely many mislead (others) by their evil desires through lack of knowledge. Assuredly, thy Lord knows best the transgressors."
"And eschew open sins as well as secret ones. Surely, those who earn sin will be rewarded for that which they have earned."
"And eat not of that on which the name of Allah has not been pronounced, for surely that is disobedience. And certainly the evil ones inspire their friends that they may dispute with you. And if you obey them, you will indeed be setting up gods (with God.)"
"Can he, who was dead and We gave him life and made for him a light whereby he walks among men, be like him whose condition is (that he is) in utter darkness whence he  cannot come forth? Thus have the doings of the disbelievers been made (to seem) fair to them."
And thus have We made in every town the great ones from among its sinners (such as are in utter darkness) with the result that they plot therein; and they plot not except against their own souls; but they perceive not.
"And when there comes to them a Sign, they say, ‘We will not believe until we are given the like of that which Allah’s Messengers have been given.’ Allah knows best where to place His Message. Surely, humiliation before Allah and a severe punishment shall smite the offenders because of their plotting."
"So, whomsoever Allah wishes to guide, He expands his bosom for (the acceptance of) Islam; and as to him whom He wishes to (let) go astray, He makes his bosom narrow (and) close, as though he were mounting up into the skies. Thus does Allah inflict punishment on those who do not believe."
And this is the path of thy Lord (leading) straight (to Him.) We have indeed explained the Signs in detail for a people who would be admonished.
"For them is the abode of peace with their Lord, and He is their Friend because of what they did."
"And on the day when He will gather them all together, (He will say), ‘O company of Jinn! you sought (to make subservient to yourselves) a great many from among men!’ And their friends from among men will say, ‘Our Lord! we profited from one another but (now) we have reached our term which Thou didst appoint for us.’ He will say, ‘The Fire is your abode, wherein you shall abide, save what Allah may will.’ Surely, thy Lord is Wise, All-Knowing."
And in like manner do We set some of the wrongdoers over the others because of what they earned.
"‘O company of Jinn and men! did not Messengers come to you from among yourselves who related to you My Signs and who warned you of the meeting of this your day?’ They will say, ‘We bear witness against ourselves.’ And the worldly life deceived them. And they will bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers."
That is because thy Lord would not destroy the towns unjustly while their people were unwarned.
"And for all are degrees (of rank) according to what they do, and thy Lord is not unmindful of what they do."
"And thy Lord is Self-Sufficient, full of mercy. If He please, He can do away with you and cause to succeed you what He pleases, even as He raised you from the offspring of other people."
"Surely, that which you are promised shall come to pass and you cannot frustrate (it)."
"Say, ‘O my people, act as best you can. I, too, am acting. Soon will you know whose will be the ultimate reward of the abode.’ Surely, the wrongdoers shall not prosper."
"And they have assigned Allah a portion of the crops and cattle which He has produced, and they say, ‘This is for Allah,’ as they imagine, ‘and this is for our idols.’ But that which is for their idols reaches not Allah, while that which is for Allah reaches their idols. Evil is what they judge."
"And in like manner have their associate-gods made the killing of their children (appear) beautiful to many of the idolaters that they may ruin them and cause them confusion in their religion. And if Allah had (enforced) His will, they would not have done this; so leave them alone with that which they invent."
"And they say, ‘Such and such cattle and crops are forbidden. None shall eat thereof save whom we please’ — so they allege — and there are cattle whose backs are forbidden, and there are cattle over which they pronounce not the name of Allah, forging a lie against Him. Soon will He requite them for that which they have fabricated."
"And they say, ‘That which is in the wombs of such and such cattle is exclusively (reserved) for our males and is forbidden to our wives; but if it be (born) dead, then they are (all) partakers thereof. He will reward them for their assertion. Surely, He is Wise, All-Knowing."
"Losers indeed are they who kill their children foolishly for lack of knowledge, and make unlawful what Allah has provided for them, forging a lie against Allah. They have indeed gone astray and are not rightly guided."
"And He it is Who brings into being gardens, trellised and untrellised, and the date-palm and cornfields whose fruits are of diverse kinds, and the olive and the pomegranate, alike and unlike. Eat of the fruit of each when it bears fruit, but pay His due on the day of harvest and exceed not the bounds. Surely, Allah loves not those who exceed the bounds."
"And of the cattle (He has created some) for burden and (some) for slaughter. Eat of that which Allah has provided for you, and follow not the footsteps of Satan. Surely, he is to you an open foe."
" (And of the cattle He has created) eight mates: of the sheep two, and of the goats two; — say, ‘Is it the two males that He has forbidden or the two females or that which the wombs of the two females contain? Inform me with knowledge, if you are truthful.’"
"And of the camels two, and of the oxen two. Say, ‘Is it the two males that He has forbidden or the two females or that which the wombs of the two females contain? Were you present when Allah enjoined this on you?’ Who is then more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah that he may lead men astray without knowledge? Surely, Allah guides not the unjust people."
"Say, ‘I find not in what has been revealed to me aught forbidden to an eater (who wishes) to eat it, except it be that which dies of itself, or blood poured forth, or the flesh of swine — for (all) that is unclean — or what is profane, on which is invoked the name of other than Allah. But whoso is driven by necessity, being neither disobedient nor exceeding (the limit), then surely thy Lord is Most Forgiving, Merciful.’"
"And to those who are Jews We forbade all animals having claws; and of the oxen and the sheep and goats did We forbid them their fats, save that which their backs bear or the intestines, or that which is mixed with a bone. That is the reward We gave them for their rebellion. And most surely We are truthful."
"But if they accuse thee of falsehood, say, ‘Your Lord is possessed of all-embracing mercy, and His wrath shall not be turned back from the guilty people.’"
"Those who join gods (with God) will say, ‘If Allah had pleased, we could not have joined gods (with Him), nor could our fathers; nor could we have made anything unlawful.’ In like manner did those who were before them accuse (God’s Messengers) of falsehood, until they tasted of Our wrath. Say, ‘Have you any knowledge? Then produce it for us. You follow nothing but (mere) conjecture. And you do nothing but lie.’"
"Say, ‘Allah’s is the argument that reaches (home.) If He had  (enforced) His will, He could have surely guided you all.’"
"Say, ‘Bring forward your witnesses who testify that Allah has forbidden this.’ If they bear witness, bear thou not witness with them, nor follow thou the evil inclinations of those who treat Our Signs as lies and those who believe not in the Hereafter and who set up equals to their Lord."
"Say, ‘Come, I will rehearse to you what your Lord has forbidden: that you associate not anything as partner with Him and (that you do) good to parents, and that you kill not your children for (fear of) poverty — it is We Who provide for you and for them — and that you approach not foul deeds, whether open or secret; and that you kill not the life which Allah has made sacred, save by right. That is what He has enjoined upon you, that you may understand."
"‘And approach not the property of the orphan, except in (a way) which is best, till he attains his maturity. And give full measure and weight with equity. We task not any soul except according to its capacity. And when you speak, observe justice, even if (the concerned person) be a relative, and fulfil the covenant of Allah. That is what He enjoins upon you, that you may remember.’"
"And (say), ‘This is My path (leading) straight. So follow it; and follow not (other) ways, lest they lead you away from His way. That is what He enjoins upon you, that you may (become able to) guard (against evils).’"
"Again, We gave Moses the Book — completing the favour upon him who did good, and an explanation of all (necessary) things, and a guidance and a mercy — that they might believe in the meeting with their Lord."
"And this is a Book which We have sent down; (it is) full of blessings. So follow it, and guard against (sin) that you may be shown mercy;"
"Lest You should say, ‘The Book was sent down only to two peoples before us, and we were indeed unaware of their reading;’"
"Or lest you should say, ‘Had the Book been sent down to us, we should surely have been better guided than they.’ There has (now) come to you a clear evidence from your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy. Who, then, is more unjust than he who rejects the Signs of Allah and turns away from them? We will requite those who turn away from Our Signs with an evil punishment because of their turning away."
"Do they expect aught but that angels should come to them or that thy Lord should come or that some of the Signs of thy Lord should come? The day when some of the Signs of thy Lord shall come, to believe in them shall not profit a soul which believed not before, nor earned any good by its faith. Say, ‘Wait ye, we (too) are waiting.’"
" (As for) those who split up their religion and became (divided into) sects, thou hast no concern at all with them. Surely their case will come before Allah, then will He  inform them of what they used to do."
"Whoso does a good deed shall have ten times as much; but he who does an evil deed, shall have only a like reward; and they shall not be wronged."
"Say, ‘As for me, my Lord has guided me unto a straight path — a right religion, the religion of Abraham, the upright. And he was not of those who join gods (with God).’"
"Say, ‘My Prayer and my sacrifice and my life and my death are (all) for Allah, the Lord of the worlds."
"‘He has no partner. And so am I commanded, and I am the first of those who submit.’"
"Say, ‘Shall I seek a lord other than Allah, while He is the Lord of all things?’ And no soul acts but only against itself; nor does any bearer of burden bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord will be your return, and He will inform you of that wherein you used to differ."
"And He it is Who has made you successors (of others) on the earth and has exalted some of you over the others in degrees (of rank), that He may try you by that which He has given you. Surely, thy Lord is quick in punishment; and surely He is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
Alif Lam Mim Sad.
" (This is) a Book revealed unto thee — so let there be no straitness in thy bosom concerning it — that thou mayest warn thereby, and (that it be) an exhortation to the believers."
"Follow that which has been sent down to you from your Lord, and follow no protectors other than Him. How little do you remember!"
How many a town have We destroyed! And Our punishment came upon it by night or while they slept at noon.
"So when Our punishment came upon them, their cry was nothing but that they said: ‘We were indeed wrongdoers!’"
"And We will certainly question those to whom (the Messengers) were sent, and We will certainly question the Messengers."
"Then will We certainly relate to them (their deeds) with knowledge, for We were never absent."
"And the weighing on that day will be true. Then as for those whose scales are heavy, it is they who shall prosper."
"And as for those whose scales are light, it is they who shall have ruined their souls because of their being unjust to Our Signs."
And We have established you in the earth and provided for you therein the means of subsistence. How little thanks you give!
"And We did create you (and) then We gave you shape; then said We to the angels, ‘Submit to Adam;’ and they (all) submitted but Iblis (did not); he would not be of those who submit."
" (God) said, ‘What prevented thee from submitting when I commanded thee?’ He said, ‘I am better than he. Thou hast created me of fire while him hast Thou created of clay.’"
" (God) said, ‘Then go down hence; it is not for thee to be arrogant here. Get out; thou art certainly of those who are abased.’"
"He said, ‘Grant me respite till the day when they will be raised up.’"
" (God) said, ‘Thou shalt be of those who are given respite.’"
"He said: ‘Now, since Thou hast adjudged me as lost, I will assuredly lie in wait for them on Thy straight path."
"‘Then will I surely come upon them from before them and from behind them and from their right and from their left, and Thou wilt not find most of them to be grateful.’"
" (God) said: ‘Get out hence, despised and banished. Whosoever of them shall follow thee, I will surely fill Hell with you all.’"
"‘And O Adam, dwell thou and thy wife in the garden and eat therefrom wherever you will, but approach not this tree lest you be among the wrongdoers.’"
"But Satan whispered (evil suggestions) to them so that he might make known to them what was hidden from them of their shame, and said, ‘Your Lord has only forbidden you this tree, lest you should become angels or such (beings) as live for ever.’"
"And he swore to them, (saying), ‘Surely, I am a sincere counsellor unto you.’"
"So he caused them to fall (into disobedience) by deceit. And when they tasted of the tree, their shame became manifest to them and they began to stick the leaves of the garden (together) over themselves. And their Lord called them, (saying), ‘Did I not forbid you that tree and tell you: verily, Satan is to you an open foe?’"
"They said, ‘Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves; and if Thou forgive us not and have not mercy on us, we shall surely be of the lost.’"
"He said, ‘Go forth, some of you (being) enemies of others. And for you there is an abode on the earth and a provision for a time.’"
"He said, ‘Therein shall you live, and therein shall you die, and therefrom shall you be brought forth.’"
"O children of Adam! We have indeed sent down to you raiment to cover your shame, and to be an elegant dress; but the raiment of righteousness — that is the best. That is (one) of the Signs of Allah, that they may remember."
"O children of Adam! let not Satan seduce you, even as he turned your parents out of the garden, stripping them of their raiment that he might show them their shame. Truly he sees you, he and his tribe, from where you see them not. Surely, We have made satans friends for those who believe not."
"And when they commit a foul deed, they say: ‘We found our fathers doing it, and Allah has enjoined it upon us.’ Say, ‘Allah never enjoins foul deeds. Do you say of Allah what you know not?’"
"Say, ‘My Lord has enjoined justice. And fix your attention aright at every (time and) place of worship, and call upon Him, making yourselves sincere towards Him in religion. As He brought you into being, so shall you return.’"
"Some has He guided, and (as for) others error has become their desert. They have taken evil ones for friends to the exclusion of Allah, and they think that they are rightly guided."
"O children of Adam! look to your adornment at every (time and) place of worship, and eat and drink but exceed not the bounds; surely, He does not love those who exceed the bounds."
"Say, ‘Who has forbidden the adornment of Allah which He has produced for His servants, and the good things of (His) providing?’ Say, ‘They are for the believers in the present life (and) exclusively (for them) on the Day of Resurrection. Thus do We explain the Signs for a people who have knowledge.’"
"Say, ‘My Lord has only forbidden foul deeds, whether open or secret, and sin and wrongful transgression, and that you associate with Allah that for which He has sent down no authority, and that you say of Allah that of which you have no knowledge.’"
"And for every people there is a term, and when their term is come, they cannot remain behind a single moment, nor can they get ahead (of it)."
"O children of Adam! if Messengers come to you from among yourselves, rehearsing My Signs unto you, then whoso shall fear God and do good deeds, on them (shall come) no fear nor shall they grieve."
"But those who reject Our Signs and turn away from them with disdain, these shall be the inmates of the Fire; they shall abide therein."
"Who is, then, more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah or gives the lie to His Signs? It is these who shall have their lot as ordained till when Our messengers shall visit them to take away their souls, they shall say, ‘Where is that which you used to call upon beside Allah?’ They will answer, ‘We cannot find them;’ and they will bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers."
"He will say, ‘Enter ye into the Fire among the nations of Jinn and men who passed away before you.’ Every time a people enters, it shall curse its sister (people) until, when they have all successively arrived therein, the last of them will say of the first of them: ‘Our Lord, these  led us astray, so give them a double punishment of the Fire.’ He will say, ‘For each (preceding party) there shall be double (punishment), but you do not know.’"
And the first of them will say to the last of them: ‘You have then no superiority over us; taste therefore the punishment for all that you did.’
"Those who reject Our Signs and turn away from them with disdain, the gates of the (spiritual) firmament will not be opened for them, nor will they enter Heaven until a camel goes through the eye of a needle. And thus do We requite the offenders."
"They shall have a bed of Hell, and over them coverings (of the same.) And thus do We requite the unjust."
But (as to) those who believe and do good works — (and) We task not any soul beyond its capacity — these are the inmates of Heaven; they shall abide therein.
"And We shall remove whatever rancour may be in their hearts. Beneath them shall flow rivers. And they shall say, ‘All praise belongs to Allah Who has guided us to this. And we could not have found guidance, if Allah had not guided us. The Messengers of our Lord did indeed bring the truth.’ And it shall be proclaimed unto them: ‘This is the Heaven which you have been given for an inheritance (as a reward) for what you used to do.’"
"And the inmates of Heaven will call out to the inmates of Hell: ‘We have indeed found what our Lord promised us to be true. Have you too  found what your Lord promised you to be true?’ They shall say: ‘Yes’. Then a proclaimer shall proclaim between them (saying), ‘The curse of Allah is on the wrongdoers — "
"‘Who turn (men) away from the path of Allah and seek to make it crooked, and who are disbelievers in the Hereafter.’"
"And between the two there shall be a partition, and on the elevated places there shall be men who will know all by their marks. And they will call out to the people of Heaven: ‘Peace be on you.’ These will not have (yet) entered it although they will be hoping (to do so.)"
"And when their eyes are turned towards the people of the Fire, they will say, ‘Our Lord, put us not with the unjust people.’"
"And the occupants of the elevated places will call out to men whom they will know by their marks, (and) say, “Your multitude availed you not, nor your arrogance."
"“Are these the men about whom you swore that Allah would not extend mercy to them? (To them it has been said), ‘Enter Paradise; no fear (shall come) upon you, nor shall you grieve.’”"
"And the inmates of the Fire will call out to the inmates of Heaven, ‘Pour out on us some water or some of that which Allah has provided for you.’ They will say, ‘Verily, Allah has forbidden them both to disbelievers — "
"‘Those who took their religion for a pastime and a sport, and whom the life of the world beguiled.’ This day, then, shall We forget them as  they forgot the meeting of this day of theirs, and as they used to deny Our Signs."
"And surely We have brought them a Book which We have expounded with knowledge, a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe."
"Do they wait only for the fulfilment (of warnings) thereof? On the day when the fulfilment thereof shall come, those who had forgotten it before shall say, ‘The Messengers of our Lord did indeed bring the truth. Have we then any intercessors to intercede for us? Or could we be sent back so that we might do (deeds) other than that which we used to do?’ They have indeed ruined their souls and that which they used to fabricate has failed them."
"Surely, your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six periods; then He settled Himself on the Throne. He makes the night cover the day, which pursues it swiftly. And (He created) the sun and the moon and the stars, (all) made subservient by His command. Verily, His is the creation and the command. Blessed is Allah, the Lord of the worlds."
"Call upon your Lord in humility and in secret. Surely, He does not love the transgressors."
"And create not disorder in the earth after it has been set in order, and call upon Him in fear and hope. Surely, the mercy of Allah is nigh unto those who do good."
"And He it is Who sends the winds as glad tidings before His mercy, till, when they bear a heavy cloud, We drive it to a dead land,  then We send down water therefrom, and We bring forth therewith fruits of every kind. In like manner do We bring forth the dead that you may remember."
"And (as for) the good land, its vegetation comes forth (plentifully) by the command of its Lord; and that which is bad, (its vegetation) does not come forth but scantily. In like manner do We vary the Signs for a people who are grateful."
"We sent Noah to his people and he said, ‘O my people, worship Allah, you have no other God but Him. Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of the great day.’"
"The chiefs of his people said, ‘Surely, we see thee to be in manifest error.’"
"He said, ‘O my people, there is no error in me, but I am a Messenger from the Lord of the worlds."
"‘I deliver to you the messages of my Lord and give you sincere advice, and I know from Allah what you do not know."
"‘Do you wonder that an exhortation has come to you from your Lord through a man from among yourselves, that he may warn you and that you may become righteous and that you may be shown mercy?’"
"But they accused him of falsehood, so We saved him and those with him in the Ark, and We drowned those who rejected Our Signs. They were indeed a blind people."
"And unto ‘Ad (We sent) their brother Hud. He said, ‘O my people, worship Allah; you have no other deity but Him. Will you not then be God-fearing?’"
"The disbelieving chiefs of his people said, ‘We surely see thee (lost) in foolishness, and we surely think thee to be (one) of the liars.’"
"He replied, ‘O my people, there is no foolishness in me, but I am a Messenger from the Lord of the worlds."
‘I deliver to you the messages of my Lord and I am to you a sincere and faithful counsellor.
"‘Do you wonder that an exhortation has come to you from your Lord through a man from among yourselves that he may warn you? And remember (the time) when He made you inheritors (of His favours) after the people of Noah, and increased you abundantly in constitution. Remember, then, the favours of Allah, that you may prosper.’"
"They said, ‘Hast thou come to us that we may worship Allah alone and forsake what our fathers used to worship? Bring us, then, that which thou threatenest us with, if thou art of the truthful.’"
"He replied, ‘Indeed there have (already) fallen on you punishment and wrath from your Lord. Do you dispute with me about names which you have named — you and your fathers — for which Allah has sent down no authority? Wait then, I am with you among those who wait.’"
"And We saved him and those who were with him, by Our mercy, and We cut off the last remnant of those who rejected Our Signs. And they were not believers."
"And to Thamud (We sent) their brother Salih. He said, ‘O my people, worship Allah; you have no other deity but Him. Verily there has  come to you a clear evidence from your Lord — this she-camel of Allah, a Sign for you. So leave her that she may feed in Allah’s earth, and do her no harm, lest a painful punishment seize you."
"And remember (the time) when He made you inheritors (of His favours) after ‘Ad, and assigned you an abode in the land; you build palaces in its plains, and you hew the mountains into houses. Remember, therefore, the favours of Allah and commit not iniquity in the earth, causing disorder.’"
"The chief men of his people who were arrogant said to those who were reckoned weak — those among them who believed — ‘Do you know (for certain) that Salih is one sent by his Lord?’ They answered, ‘Surely, we believe in that with which he has been sent.’"
"Those who were arrogant said, ‘Verily, we do disbelieve in that in which you believe.’"
"Then they hamstrung the shecamel and rebelled against the command of their Lord, and said, ‘O Salih, bring us that which thou threatenest us with, if thou art (indeed one) of the Messengers.’"
So the earthquake seized them and in their homes they lay prostrate upon the ground.
"Then (Salih) turned away from them and said, ‘O my people, I did deliver the message of my Lord unto you and offered you sincere counsel, but you love not sincere counsellors.’"
"And (We sent) Lot — when he said to his people, ‘Do you commit an abomination such as no one in the world ever did before you?"
"‘You approach men with lust instead of women. Nay, you are a people who exceed (all) bounds.’"
"And the answer of his people was no other than that they said, ‘Turn them out of your town, for they are men who would keep pure.’"
"And We saved him and his family, except his wife: she was of those who stayed behind."
"And We rained upon them a rain. Now see, what was the end of the sinners!"
"And to Midian (We sent) their brother Shu‘aib. He said, ‘O my people, worship Allah; you have no other deity but Him. A clear Sign has indeed come to you from your Lord. So give full measure and full weight, and diminish not unto people their things, and create not disorder in the earth after it has been set in order. This is better for you, if you are believers."
"‘And sit not on every path, threatening and turning away from the path of Allah those who believe in Him, and seeking to make it crooked. And remember when you were few and He multiplied you. And behold, what was the end of those who created disorder!"
"‘And if there is a party among you who believes in that with which I have been sent, and a party who does not believe, then have patience until Allah judges between us. And He is the Best of judges.’"
"The chief men of his people who were arrogant said, ‘Assuredly, we will drive thee out, O Shu‘aib, and the believers (that are) with thee, from our town, or you shall have to return to our religion.’ He said: ‘Even though we be unwilling?"
"‘We have indeed been forging a lie against Allah, if we (now) return to your religion after Allah has saved us therefrom. And it behoves us not to return thereto except that Allah, our Lord, should (so) will. Our Lord comprehends all things in (His) knowledge. In Allah have we put our trust. (So) O our Lord, decide Thou between us and between our people with truth, and Thou art the Best of those who decide.’"
"And the chief men of his people who disbelieved said, ‘If you follow Shu‘aib, you shall then certainly be the losers.’"
So the earthquake seized them and in their homes they lay prostrate upon the ground.
Those who accused Shu‘aib of lying became as if they had never dwelt therein. Those who accused Shu‘aib of lying — it was they who were the losers.
"Then he turned away from them and said, ‘O my people, indeed, I delivered to you the messages of my Lord and gave you sincere counsel. How then should I sorrow for a disbelieving people?’"
"And never did We send a Prophet to any town but We seized the people thereof with adversity and suffering, that they might become humble."
"Then We changed (their) evil (condition) into good until they grew (in affluence and number) and said, ‘Suffering and happiness betided our fathers (also.)’ Then We seized them suddenly, while they perceived not."
"And if the people of (those) towns had believed and been righteous, We would have surely opened for them blessings from heaven and earth; but they disbelieved, so We seized them because of that which they used to earn."
"Are the people of (these) towns, then, secure from the coming of Our punishment upon them by night while they are asleep?"
And are the people of (these) towns secure from the coming of Our punishment upon them in the early part of the forenoon while they are engaged in play?
Are they then secure from the design of Allah? And none feels secure from the design of Allah save the people that perish.
"Does it not afford guidance to those who have inherited the earth in succession to its (former) inhabitants, that if We please, We can smite them for their sins and seal up their hearts, so that they should not hear?"
Such were the towns some of whose news We have related to thee. And their Messengers did indeed come to them with clear Signs. But they would not believe what they had disbelieved before. In this manner does Allah seal up the hearts of the disbelievers.
And We found not in most of them any (observance of) covenant  and surely We found most of them to be evil-doers.
"Then, after them, We sent Moses with Our Signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they unjustly (rejected) them. Behold, then, what was the end of those who created disorder!"
"And Moses said, ‘O Pharaoh, (truly), I am a Messenger from the Lord of the worlds."
"‘It is not meet that I should say anything of Allah except the truth. I have come to you with a clear Sign from your Lord; therefore, let the children of Israel go with me.’"
" (Pharaoh) replied, ‘If thou hast indeed come with a Sign, then produce it, if thou art of the truthful.’"
"So he flung down his rod, and behold! it was a serpent plainly visible."
"And he drew forth his hand, and lo! it was white for the beholders."
"The chiefs of Pharaoh’s people said, ‘This is most surely a skilful magician."
‘He desires to turn you out from your land. Now what do you advise?’
"They said, ‘Put him off and his brother (awhile), and send into the cities summoners,"
‘Who should bring to thee every skilful magician.’
"And the magicians came to Pharaoh (and) said: ‘We shall, of course, have a reward, if we prevail.’"
"He said, ‘Yes, and you shall (also) be of those who are placed near (me).’"
"They said, ‘O Moses, either throw thou (first), or we shall be the (first) throwers.’"
"He replied, ‘Throw ye.’ And when they threw, they enchanted the eyes of the people, and struck them with awe and brought forth a great magic."
"And We inspired Moses, (saying), ‘Throw thy rod,’ and lo! it swallowed up whatever they feigned."
"So was the Truth established, and their works proved vain."
"Thus were they vanquished there, and they returned humiliated."
And the magicians were impelled to fall down prostrate.
" (And) they said, ‘We believe in the Lord of the worlds,"
‘The Lord of Moses and Aaron.’
"Pharaoh said, ‘You have believed in him before I gave you leave. Surely, this is a plot that you have plotted in the city, that you may turn out therefrom its inhabitants, but you shall soon know (the consequences.)"
‘Most surely will I cut off your hands and your feet on alternate sides. Then will I surely crucify you all together.
"They answered, ‘To our Lord (then) shall we return."
"‘And thou dost not wreak vengeance on us but because we have believed in the Signs of our Lord, when they came to us. Our Lord, pour forth upon us steadfastness and cause us to die resigned (unto Thee).’"
"And the chiefs of Pharaoh’s people said, ‘Wilt thou leave Moses and his people to create disorder in the land, and forsake thee and thy gods?’ He answered, ‘We will ruthlessly slay their sons and let their women live. And surely we are dominant over them.’"
"Moses said to his people, ‘Seek help from Allah and be steadfast. Verily, the earth is Allah’s ; He gives it as a heritage to whomsoever He pleases of His servants, and the end is for the God-fearing.’"
"They replied, ‘We were persecuted before thou camest to us and (even) after thou camest to us.’ He said, ‘Your Lord is about to destroy your enemy and make you rulers in the land, (that) He may then see how you act.’"
"And We punished Pharaoh’s people with drought and scarcity of fruits, that they might be admonished."
"But when there came to them good, they said, ‘This is for us.’ And if evil befell them, they ascribed the evil fortune to Moses and those with him. Now, surely, (the cause of) their evil fortune is with Allah. But most of them do not know."
"And they said, ‘Whatever Sign thou mayest bring us to bewitch us with, we will not believe in thee.’"
"Then We sent upon them the storm and the locusts, and the lice, and the frogs, and the blood — clear Signs; but they behaved proudly and were a sinful people."
"And when there fell upon them the punishment, they said, ‘O Moses, pray for us to thy Lord according to that which He has promised to thee. If thou remove from us the punishment, we will surely believe in thee and we will surely send with thee the children of Israel.’"
"But when We removed from them the punishment for a term which they were to reach, lo! they broke their promise."
"So We took vengeance upon them and drowned them in the sea, because they treated Our Signs as lies and were heedless of them."
"And We caused the people who were considered weak to inherit the eastern parts of the land and the western parts thereof, which We blessed. And the gracious word of thy Lord was fulfilled for the children of Israel because they were steadfast; and We destroyed all that Pharaoh and his people had built and all that they had erected."
"And We brought the children of Israel across the sea, and they came to a people who were devoted to their idols. They said, ‘O Moses, make for us a god just as they have gods.’ He said, ‘Surely, you are an ignorant people."
"‘(As to) these, surely destroyed shall be all that they are engaged in, and vain shall be all that they do.’"
"He said, ‘Shall I seek for you a god other than Allah, while He has exalted you above all peoples?’"
"And (remember the time) when We delivered you from Pharaoh’s people who afflicted you with grievous torment, slaughtering your  sons and sparing your women. And therein was a great trial for you from your Lord."
"And We made Moses a promise of thirty nights and supplemented them with ten. Thus the period appointed by his Lord was completed —  forty nights. And Moses said to his brother, Aaron, ‘Act for me among my people in my absence, and manage (them) well, and follow not the way of those who cause disorder.’"
"And when Moses came at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said, ‘My Lord, show (Thyself) to me that I may look at Thee.’ He replied, ‘Thou shalt not see Me, but look at the mountain; if it remains in its place, then shalt thou see Me.’ And when his Lord manifested Himself on the mountain, He broke it into pieces and Moses fell down unconscious. And when he recovered, he said, ‘Holy art Thou, I turn towards Thee, and I am the first to believe.’"
" (God) said, ‘O Moses, I have chosen thee above the people (of thy time) by My messages and by My word. So take hold of that which I have given thee and be of the grateful.’"
And We wrote for him upon the tablets about everything — an admonition and an explanation of all things. ‘So hold them fast and bid thy people follow the best thereof. Soon shall I show you the abode of the transgressors.’
"I shall soon turn away from My Signs those who behave proudly in the land in an unjust manner; and even if they see all the Signs, they will not believe therein; and if they see the way of righteousness, they  will not adopt it as (their) way; but if they see the way of error, they will adopt it as (their) way. That is because they treated Our Signs as lies and were heedless of them."
And those who disbelieve in Our Signs and the meeting of the Hereafter — their works are vain. Can they (expect to) be rewarded (for anything) except for what they do?
"And the people of Moses made, in his absence, out of their ornaments a calf — a (lifeless) body producing a lowing sound. Did they not see that it spoke not to them, nor guided them to any way? They took it (for worship) and they were transgressors."
"And when they were smitten with remorse and saw that they had indeed gone astray, they said, ‘If our Lord do not have mercy on us and forgive us, we shall surely be among the losers.’"
"And when Moses returned to his people, indignant and grieved, he said, ‘Evil is that which you did in my place in my absence. Did you hasten (to devise a way for yourselves without waiting for) the command of your Lord?’ And he put down the tablets, and caught hold of his brother’s head, dragging him towards himself. He (Aaron) said, ‘Son of my mother, the people indeed deemed me weak, and were about to kill me. Therefore make not the enemies rejoice over me, and place me not with the unjust people.’"
"He (Moses) said, ‘My Lord, forgive me and my brother, and admit us to Thy mercy, and Thou art the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.’"
" (As to) those who took the calf (for worship), wrath from their Lord shall overtake them and abasement in the present life. And thus do We reward those who invent lies."
"But those who did evil deeds and repented after that and believed, surely thy Lord is thereafter Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"And when the anger of Moses was appeased, he took the tablets, and in their writing there was guidance and mercy for those who fear their Lord."
"And Moses chose of his people seventy men for Our appointment. But when the earthquake overtook them, he said, ‘My Lord, if Thou hadst pleased, Thou couldst have destroyed them before (this), and me (also). Wilt Thou destroy us for that which the foolish among us have done? This is nothing but a trial from Thee. Thou causest to perish thereby whom Thou pleasest and Thou guidest whom Thou pleasest. Thou art our Protector; forgive us then and have mercy on us, for Thou art the Best of those who forgive."
"‘And ordain for us good in this world, as well as in the next; we have turned to Thee (with repentance).’ (God) replied, ‘I will inflict My punishment on whom I will; but My mercy encompasses all things; so I will ordain it for those who act righteously, and pay the Zakat and those who believe in Our Signs — "
"‘Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet, the Immaculate one, whom they find mentioned in the Torah and the Gospel (which are) with them. He enjoins on them good and forbids  them evil, and makes lawful for them the good things and forbids them the bad, and removes from them their burden and the shackles that were upon them. So those who shall believe in him, and honour and support him, and help him, and follow the light that has been sent down with him — these shall prosper.’"
"Say, ‘O mankind! truly I am a Messenger to you all from Allah to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. There is no God but He. He gives life, and He causes death. So believe in Allah and His Messenger, the Prophet, the Immaculate one, who believes in Allah and His words; and follow him that you may be rightly guided.’"
And of the people of Moses there is a party that exhorts (people) to truth and does justice therewith.
"And We divided them into twelve tribes, (distinct) peoples. And We revealed to Moses, when his people asked drink of him, (saying), ‘Strike the rock with thy rod;’ and from it there gushed forth twelve springs; every tribe knew their drinking place. And We caused the clouds to overshadow them, and We sent down for them Manna and Salwa: ‘Eat of the good things We have provided for you.’ And they wronged Us not, but it was themselves that they wronged."
"And when it was said to them, “Dwell in this town and eat therefrom wherever you will, and say, ‘(God)! lighten (our) burden,’ and enter the gate in humility, We shall forgive you your sins, (and) surely We shall give increase to those who do good.”"
"But the transgressors among them changed (it) for a word other than that which was said to them. So We sent upon them a punishment from heaven, because of their wrongdoing."
"And ask them concerning the town which stood by the sea. When they profaned the Sabbath; when their fish came to them on their Sabbath day appearing on the surface (of the water), but on the day when they did not keep the Sabbath, they came not to them. Thus did We try them because they were rebellious."
"And when a party among them said, ‘Wherefore do you preach to a people whom Allah is going to destroy or punish with a severe punishment?’ They said, ‘As an excuse before your Lord, and that they may become righteous.’"
"And when they forgot all that with which they had been admonished, We saved those who forbade evil, and We seized the transgressors with a severe punishment because they were rebellious."
"And when they insolently rebelled against that which they had been forbidden, We said to them, ‘Be ye apes, despised!’"
"And (remember the time) when thy Lord proclaimed that He would truly raise against them, till the Day of Resurrection, those who would afflict them with grievous torment. Surely, thy Lord is quick in retribution, and surely He is (also) Most Forgiving, Merciful."
And We broke them up into (separate) peoples in the earth. Among them are those that are righteous and among them are those that are otherwise. And We tried them with good things and bad things that they might return.
"Then there has come an (evil) generation after them who inherited the Book. They take the paltry goods of this low (world) and say, ‘It will be forgiven us.’ But if there came to them similar goods (again), they would take them. Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them, that they would not say of Allah (anything) but the truth? And they have studied what is therein. And the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who are righteous. Will you not then understand?"
"And (as to) those who hold fast by the Book, and observe Prayer, surely We suffer not the reward of (such) righteous (people) to perish."
"And when We shook the mountain over them as though it were a covering, and they thought it was going to fall on them, (We said), ‘Hold fast that which We have given you, and remember what is therein that you may be saved.’"
"And when thy Lord brings forth from Adam’s children — out of their loins — their offspring and makes them witnesses against their own selves (by saying): ‘Am I not your Lord?’ They say, ‘Yea, we do bear witness.’ (This He does) lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection, ‘We were surely unaware of this.’"
"Or (lest) you should say, ‘It was only our fathers who attributed copartners (to God) in the past and we were (merely) a generation after them. Wilt Thou then destroy us for what was done by those who lied?’"
"And thus do We make clear the Signs, (that they may be admonished) and that they may return (to Us.)"
"And relate to them the story of him to whom We gave Our Signs, but he stepped away from them; so Satan followed him up, and he became (one) of those who go astray."
"And if We had pleased, We could have exalted him thereby; but he inclined to the earth and followed his evil inclination. His case therefore is like the case of a (thirsty) dog; if thou drive him away, he hangs out his tongue; and if thou leave him, he hangs out his tongue. Such is the case of the people who disbelieve in Our Signs. So give (them) the description that they may ponder."
Evil is the case of the people who treat Our Signs as lies. And it was their own selves that they wronged.
"He whom Allah guides is on the right path. And they whom He adjudges astray, these it is who shall be the losers."
"Verily, We have created many of the Jinn and men whose end shall be Hell! They have hearts (but) they understand not therewith, and they have eyes (but) they see not therewith, and they have ears (but) they hear not therewith. They are like cattle; nay, they are (even) more astray. They are indeed (quite) heedless."
And to Allah (alone) belong (all) perfect attributes. So call on Him by these. And leave alone those who deviate from the right way with respect to His attributes. They shall be repaid for what they do.
And of those We have created there are a people that guide (men) with truth and do justice therewith.
"And those who reject Our Signs, We will draw them (to destruction) step by step in a manner which they do not know."
"And I give them the rein; surely, My plan is mighty."
Have they not considered (that) there is no insanity about their companion? He is only a plain Warner.
"And have they not looked into the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and all things that Allah has created? And (do they not see) that, maybe their (own) term has already drawn nigh? Then in what thing will they believe thereafter?"
"Whomsoever Allah adjudges astray, there can be no guide for him. And He leaves such in their transgression, wandering in distraction."
"They ask thee respecting the Hour: ‘When will it come to pass?’ Say, ‘The knowledge thereof is only with my Lord. None can manifest it at its time but He. It lies heavy on the heavens and the earth. It shall not come upon you but of a sudden.’ They ask thee as if thou wert well acquainted therewith. Say, ‘The knowledge thereof is only with Allah; but most men do not know.’"
"Say, ‘I have no power to do good or harm to myself, save as Allah please. And if I had knowledge  of the unseen, I should have secured abundance of good’ and evil would not have touched me. I am only a warner and a bearer of good tidings to a people who believe.’"
"He it is Who has created you from a single soul, and made therefrom its mate, that he might find comfort in her. And when he knows her, she bears a light burden, and goes about with it. And when she grows heavy, they both pray to Allah, their Lord, (saying): ‘If Thou give us a good (child,) we will surely be of the thankful.’"
"But when He gives them a good (child,) they attribute to Him partners in respect of that which He has given them. But exalted is Allah above what they associate (with Him.)"
"Do they associate (with Him) as partners those who create nothing, and are themselves created?"
"And they can give them no help, nor can they help themselves."
"And if you call them to guidance, they will not follow you. It is the same to you whether you call them or you remain silent."
"Surely, those whom you call on beside Allah are (mere) servants like you. Then call on them and let them answer you, if you are truthful."
"Have they feet wherewith they walk, or have they hands wherewith they hold, or have they eyes wherewith they see, or have they ears wherewith they hear? Say, ‘Call upon the partners you associate (with) (God), then contrive (ye all) against me, and give me no time."
"‘Truly, my protector is Allah Who revealed the Book. And He protects the righteous."
"‘And they whom you call on beside Him have no power to help you, nor can they help themselves.’"
"And if you invite them to guidance, they hear not. And thou seest them looking towards thee, but they see not."
"Take to forgiveness, and enjoin kindness, and turn away from the ignorant."
"And if an evil suggestion from Satan incite thee, then seek refuge in Allah; surely, He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
" (As to) those who are righteous, when a suggestion from Satan assails them, they remember (God): and behold! they begin to see (things rightly)."
"And their brethren make them continue in error, and then they relax not."
"And when thou bringest not to them a Sign, they say, ‘Wherefore dost thou not forge it?’ Say, ‘I follow only that which is revealed to me from my Lord. These are evidences from your Lord, and guidance and mercy for a people that believe.’"
"And when the Qur’an is recited, give ear to it and keep silence, that you may be shown mercy."
"And remember thy Lord in thy mind with humility and fear, and without loudness of speech, in the mornings and evenings; and be not of the neglectful."
"Truly, those who are near to thy Lord, turn not away with pride from His worship, but they glorify Him and prostrate themselves before Him."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"They Ask thee concerning the spoils (of war.) Say, ‘The spoils belong to Allah and the Messenger. So fear Allah, and set things right among yourselves, and obey Allah and His Messenger, if you are believers.’"
" (True) believers are only those whose hearts tremble when (the name of) Allah is mentioned, and when His Signs are recited to them they increase their faith, and who put their trust in their Lord,"
Who observe Prayer and spend out of that which We have provided for them.
"These it is who are true believers. They have grades (of rank) with their Lord, as well as forgiveness and an honourable provision."
"As (it was) thy Lord (Who) rightfully brought thee forth from thy house, while a party of the believers were averse, (therefore He helped thee against thy enemy.)"
"They dispute with thee concerning the truth after it has become manifest, as though they are being driven to death while they actually see (it)."
"And (remember the time) when Allah promised you one of the two parties‡ that it should be yours, and you wished that the one without sting should be yours, but Allah desired to establish the truth by His words and to cut off the root of the disbelievers,"
"That He might establish the truth and bring to naught that which is false, although the guilty might dislike it."
"When you implored the assistance of your Lord, and He answered you, (saying), ‘I will assist you with a thousand of the angels, following one another.’"
"And Allah made it only as glad tidings, and that your hearts might thereby be set at rest. But help comes from Allah alone; surely, Allah is Mighty, Wise."
"When He caused sleep to come upon you as a (sign of) security from Him, and He sent down water upon you from the clouds, that thereby He might purify you, and remove from you the filth of Satan, and that He might strengthen your hearts and make (your) steps firm therewith."
"When thy Lord revealed to the angels, (saying), ‘I am with you; so give firmness to those who believe. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Smite, then, the upper parts of (their) necks, and smite off all finger-tips.’"
"That is because they have opposed Allah and His Messenger. And whoso opposes Allah and His Messenger, then Allah is surely severe in retribution."
"That (is your punishment), taste it then; and (know) that for disbelievers there is the punishment of the Fire."
"O ye who believe! when you meet those who disbelieve, advancing in force, turn not (your) backs to them."
"And whoso turns his back to them on such a day, unless manoeuvring for battle or turning to (join another) company, he indeed draws upon himself the wrath of Allah, and Hell shall be his abode. And an evil resort it is."
"So you killed them not, but it was Allah Who killed them. And thou threwest not when thou didst throw, but it was Allah Who threw, (that He might overthrow the disbelievers) and that He might confer on the believers a great favour from Himself. Surely, Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
That (is what happened); and (know) that Allah is He Who weakens the design of the disbelievers.
"If you sought a judgment, then judgment has indeed come to you. And if you desist, it will be better for you; but if you return (to hostility), We (too) will return. And your party shall be of no avail at all to you, however numerous it be, and (know) that Allah is with the believers."
"O ye who believe! obey Allah and His Messenger, and do not turn away from him while you hear (him speak)."
"And be not like those who say, ‘We hear,’ but they hear not."
"Surely, the worst of beasts in the sight of Allah are the deaf (and) the dumb, who have no sense."
"And if Allah had known any good in them, He would certainly have made them hear. And if He (now) makes them hear, they will turn away, in aversion."
"O ye who believe! respond to Allah, and the Messenger when he calls you that he may give you life, and know that Allah comes in between a man and his heart, and that He it is unto Whom you shall be gathered."
And beware of an affliction which will not smite exclusively those among you who have done wrong. And know that Allah is severe in requiting.
"And remember (the time) when you were few (and) deemed weak in the land, (and) were in fear lest people should snatch you away, but He sheltered you and strengthened you with His help, and provided you with good things that you might be thankful."
"O ye who believe! prove not false to Allah and the Messenger, nor prove false to your trusts knowingly."
And know that your possessions and your children are but a trial and that it is Allah with Whom is a great reward.
"O ye who believe! if you fear Allah, He will grant you a distinction and will remove your evils from you and will forgive you; and Allah is (Lord) of great bounty."
"And (remember the time) when the disbelievers plotted against thee that they might imprison thee or kill thee or expel thee. And they planned and Allah (also) planned, and Allah is the Best of planners."
"And when Our verses are recited to them, they say, ‘We have heard. If we wished we could certainly utter the like of this. This is nothing but (mere) tales of the ancients.’"
"And (remember the time) when they said, ‘O Allah, if this be indeed the truth from Thee, then rain down upon us stones from heaven or bring down upon us a grievous punishment.’"
"But Allah would not punish them while thou wast among them, and Allah would not punish them while they sought forgiveness."
"And what excuse have they (now) that Allah should not punish them, when they hinder (men) from the Sacred Mosque, and they are not its (true) guardians? Its (true) guardians are only those who are righteous, but most of them know not."
And their prayer at the House is nothing but whistling and clapping of hands. ‘Taste then the punishment because you disbelieved.’
"Surely, those who disbelieve spend their wealth to turn (men) away from the way of Allah. They will surely continue to spend it; (but) then shall it become a (source of) regret for them, (and) then shall they be overcome. And the disbelievers shall be gathered unto Hell;"
"That Allah may separate the bad from the good, and put the bad, one upon another, and heap them up all together, (and) then cast them into Hell. These indeed are the losers."
"Say to those who disbelieve, if they desist, that which is past will be forgiven them; and if they return (thereto), then verily, the example of the former peoples has already gone (before them)."
"And fight them until there is no persecution and religion is wholly for Allah. But if they desist, then surely Allah is Watchful of what they do."
"And if they turn their backs, then know that Allah is your Protector. What an excellent Protector and what an excellent Helper!"
"And know that whatever you take as spoils (in war), a fifth thereof shall go to Allah and to the Messenger and to the kindred and orphans and the needy and the wayfarer, if you believe in Allah and in what We sent down to Our servant on the Day of Distinction — the day when the two armies met — and Allah has the power to do all things."
"When you were on the nearer bank (of the valley), and they were on the farther bank, and the caravan was below you. And if you had to make a mutual appointment, you would have certainly differed with regard to the appointment. But (the encounter was brought about) that Allah might accomplish the thing that was decreed; so that he who had (already) perished through a clear Sign might perish, and he who had (already) come to life through a clear Sign might live. And certainly Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
"When Allah showed them to thee in thy dream as few; and if He had shown them to thee as many, you would have surely faltered and would have disagreed with one another about the matter; but Allah saved (you). Surely, He has full knowledge of what is in (your) breasts."
"And when at the time of your encounter He made them appear to you as few in your eyes, and made you appear as few in their eyes, that Allah might bring about the thing that was decreed. And to Allah are all affairs referred (for final decision.)"
"O ye who believe! when you encounter an army, remain firm, and remember Allah much that you may prosper."
"And obey Allah and His Messenger and dispute not with one another, lest you falter and your power depart (from you). And be steadfast; surely, Allah is with the steadfast."
"And be not like those who came forth from their homes boastfully, and to be seen of men, and who turn (men) away from the path of Allah, and Allah encompasses all that they do."
"And when Satan made their deeds (seem) fair to them and said, ‘None among men shall prevail against you this day, and I am your protector.’ But when the two armies came in sight of each other, he turned on his heels, and said, ‘Surely, I have nothing to do with you; surely, I see what you see not. Surely, I fear Allah; and Allah is severe in punishing.’"
"When the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease said, ‘Their religion has deluded these (men).’ And whoso puts his trust in Allah, then surely, Allah is Mighty, Wise."
"And if thou couldst see, when the angels take away the souls of those who disbelieve, smiting their faces and their backs, (saying): ‘Taste ye the punishment of burning!"
"‘That is because of that which your hands have sent on before (yourselves), and (know) that Allah is not at all unjust to (His) servants.’"
" (Their case is) like the case of the people of Pharaoh and those before them: they disbelieved in the Signs of Allah; so Allah punished them for their sins. Surely, Allah is Powerful (and) severe in punishing."
"This is because Allah would never change a favour that He has conferred upon a people until they change their own condition, and (know) that Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
" (Their case is) like the case of the people of Pharaoh and those before them: they rejected the Signs of their Lord, so We destroyed them for their sins. And We drowned the people of Pharaoh, for they were all wrongdoers."
"Surely, the worst of beasts in the sight of Allah are those who are ungrateful. So they will not believe,"
"Those with whom thou didst make a covenant; then they break their covenant every time, and they do not fear God."
"So, if thou catchest them in war, then by (routing) them strike fear in those that are behind them, that they may be admonished."
"And if thou fearest treachery from a people, throw back to them (their covenant) with equity. Surely, Allah loves not the treacherous."
"And let not those who disbelieve think that they have outstripped (Us). Surely, they cannot frustrate (God’s purpose.)"
"And make ready for them whatever you can of (armed) force and of mounted pickets at the frontier, whereby you may frighten the enemy of Allah and your enemy and others besides them whom you know not, (but) Allah knows them. And whatever you spend in the way of Allah, it shall be repaid to you in full and you shall not be wronged."
"And if they incline towards peace, incline thou also towards it, and put thy trust in Allah. Surely, it is He Who is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
"And if they intend to deceive thee, then surely Allah is sufficient for thee. He it is Who has strengthened thee with His help and with the believers;"
"And He has put affection between their hearts. If thou hadst expended all that is in the earth, thou couldst not have put affection between their hearts, but Allah has put affection between them. Surely, He is Mighty, Wise."
"O Prophet, Allah is sufficient for thee and for those who follow thee of the believers."
"O Prophet, urge the believers to fight. If there be of you twenty who are steadfast, they shall overcome two hundred; and if there be a hundred of you, they shall overcome a thousand of those who disbelieve, because they are a people who do not understand."
"For the present Allah has lightened your burden, for He knows that there is weakness in you. So, if there be a hundred of you who are steadfast, they shall overcome two hundred; and if there be a thousand of you, they shall overcome two thousand by the command of Allah. And Allah is with those who are steadfast."
"It does not behove a Prophet that he should have captives until he engages in regular fighting in the land. You desire the goods of the world, while Allah desires (for you) the Hereafter. And Allah is Mighty, Wise."
"Had there not been a decree from Allah which had gone before, great distress would have surely overtaken you in (connection with that) which you took."
"So eat of that which you have won (in war) as lawful and good, and fear Allah. Surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"O Prophet, say to the captives who are in your hands, ‘If Allah knows any good in your hearts, He will give you better than that which has been taken from you, and will forgive you. And Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful.’"
"And if they intend to deal treacherously with thee, they have already dealt treacherously with Allah before, but He gave (thee) power over them. And Allah is All- Knowing, Wise."
"Surely, those who have believed and fled from their homes and striven with their property and their persons for the cause of Allah, and those who have given (them) shelter and help — these are friends one of another. But as for those who have believed but have not left their homes, you are not at all responsible for their protection until they leave their homes. But if they seek your help in (the matter of) religion, then it is your duty to help them, except against a people between whom and yourselves there is a treaty. And Allah sees what you do."
"And those who disbelieve — they are friends one of another. If you do it not, there will be mischief in the land and great disorder."
"And those who have believed and left their homes and striven for the cause of Allah, and those who have given (them) shelter and help — these indeed are true believers. For them is forgiveness and an honourable provision."
"And those who have believed since then and left their homes and striven (for the cause of Allah) along with you — these are of you; and (as to) blood relations, they are nearer one to another in the Book of Allah. Surely, Allah knows all things well."
 (This is) a declaration of (complete) absolution on the part of Allah and His Messenger (from all obligation) to the idolaters with whom you had made promises.
"So go about in the land for four months, and know that you cannot frustrate (the plan of) Allah and that Allah will humiliate the disbelievers."
"And (this is) a proclamation from Allah and His Messenger to the people on the day of the Greater Pilgrimage, that Allah is clear of the idolaters, and so is His Messenger. So if you repent, it will be better for you; but if you turn away, then know that you cannot frustrate (the plan of) Allah. And give tidings of a painful punishment to those who disbelieve,"
"Excepting those of the idolaters with whom you have entered into a treaty and who have not (subsequently) failed you in anything nor aided anyone against you. So fulfil to these the treaty (you have) made with them till their term. Surely, Allah loves those who are righteous."
"And when the forbidden months have passed, kill the idolaters wherever you find them and take them (prisoners), and beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they repent and observe Prayer and pay  the Zakat, then leave their way (free). Surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"And if anyone of the idolaters ask protection of thee, grant him protection so that he may hear the word of Allah; then convey him to his place of security. That is because they are a people who have no knowledge."
"How can there be a treaty of (these) idolaters with Allah and His Messenger, except those with whom you entered into a treaty at the Sacred Mosque? So, as long as they stand true to you, stand true to them. Surely, Allah loves those who are righteous."
"How (can it be) when, if they prevail against you, they would not observe any tie of relationship or covenant in respect of you? They would please you with their mouths, while their hearts refuse, and most of them are perfidious."
They barter the Signs of Allah for a paltry price and turn (men) away from His way. Evil indeed is that which they do.
They observe not any tie of relationship or covenant in respect of anyone who trusts (them). And it is they who are transgressors.
"But if they repent and observe Prayer and pay the Zakat, then they are your brethren in faith. And We explain the Signs for a people who have knowledge."
"And if they break their oaths after their covenant, and attack your religion, then fight (these) leaders of disbelief — surely, they have no regard for their oaths — that they may desist."
"Will you not fight a people who have broken their oaths, and who plotted to turn out the Messenger, and they were the first to commence (hostilities) against you? Do you fear them? Nay, Allah is most worthy that you should fear Him, if you are believers."
"Fight them, that Allah may punish them at your hands, and humiliate them, and help you (to victory) over them, and relieve the minds of a people who believe;"
"And that He may take away the wrath of their hearts. And Allah turns with mercy to whomsoever He pleases. And Allah is All-Knowing, Wise."
"Do you think that you would be left alone, while Allah has not yet known those of you who strive (in the cause of Allah) and do not take (anyone) for an intimate friend beside Allah and His Messenger and the believers? Allah is well aware of what you do."
"The idolaters cannot keep the Mosques of Allah in a good and flourishing condition while they bear witness against themselves to disbelief. It is they whose works shall be vain, and in the Fire shall they abide."
"He alone can keep the Mosques of Allah in a good and flourishing condition who believes in Allah, and the Last Day, and observes Prayer, and pays the Zakat, and fears none but Allah; so these it is who  may be among those who reach the goal."
"Do you hold the giving of drink to the pilgrims, and the maintenance of the Sacred Mosque as (equal to the works of) him who believes in Allah and the Last Day and strives in the path of Allah? They are not (at all) equal in the sight of Allah. And Allah guides not the unjust people."
Those who believe and emigrate (from their homes for the sake of God) and strive in the cause of Allah with their property and their persons have the highest rank in the sight of Allah. And it is they who shall triumph.
"Their Lord gives them glad tidings of mercy from Him, and of (His) pleasure, and of Gardens wherein there shall be lasting bliss for them;"
"They will abide therein for ever. Verily, with Allah there is a great reward."
"O ye who believe! take not your fathers and your brothers for friends, if they prefer disbelief to faith. And whoso befriends them from among you, it is they that are wrongdoers."
"Say, if your fathers, and your sons, and your brethren, and your wives, and your kinsfolk, and the wealth you have acquired, and the trade whose dullness you fear, and the dwellings which you love are dearer to you than Allah and His Messenger and striving in His cause, then wait until Allah comes with His judgment; and Allah guides not the disobedient people."
"Surely, Allah had helped you on many a battlefield, and on the Day of Hunain, when your great numbers made you proud, but they availed you nought; and the earth, with (all) its vastness, became straitened for you, (and) then you turned your backs retreating."
"Then Allah sent down His peace upon His Messenger and upon the believers, and He sent down hosts which you did not see, and He punished those who disbelieved. And this is the reward of the disbelievers."
"Then will Allah, after that, turn with compassion to whomsoever He pleases; and Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"O ye who believe! surely, the idolaters are unclean. So they shall not approach the Sacred Mosque after this year of theirs. And if you fear poverty, Allah will enrich you out of His bounty, if He pleases. Surely, Allah is All-Knowing, Wise."
"Fight those from among the People of the Book who believe not in Allah, nor in the Last Day, nor hold as unlawful what Allah and His Messenger have declared to be unlawful, nor follow the true religion, until they pay the tax with (their own) hand and acknowledge their subjection."
"And the Jews say, Ezra is the son of Allah, and the Christians say, the Messiah is the son of Allah; that is what they say with their mouths. They imitate the saying of those who disbelieved before them. Allah’s curse be on them! How are they turned away!"
"They have taken their learned men and their monks for lords beside Allah. And (so have they taken) the Messiah, son of Mary. And they were not commanded but to worship the One God. There is no God but He. Too Holy is He for what they associate (with Him)!"
"They desire to extinguish the light of Allah with their mouths; but Allah will permit nothing except that He will perfect His light, though the disbelievers may dislike (it)."
"He it is Who sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth, that He may make it prevail over every (other) religion, even though the idolaters may dislike (it.)"
"O ye who believe! surely, many of the priests and monks devour the wealth of men by false means and turn (men) away from the way of Allah. And those who hoard up gold and silver and spend it not in the way of Allah — give to them the tidings of a painful punishment,"
"On the day when it shall be made hot in the fire of Hell, and their foreheads and their sides and their backs shall be branded therewith (and it shall be said to them): ‘This is what you treasured up for yourselves; so now taste what you used to treasure up.’"
"The reckoning of months with Allah has been twelve months by Allah’s ordinance since the day when He created the heavens and the earth. Of these, four are sacred. That is the right creed. So wrong not yourselves therein. And fight the idolaters all together as they fight  you all together; and know that Allah is with the righteous."
"Surely, the postponement (of a Sacred Month) is an addition to disbelief. Those who disbelieve are led astray thereby. They allow it one year and forbid it another year, that they may agree in the number of (the months) which Allah has made sacred, and thus may make lawful what Allah has forbidden. The evil of their deeds is made (to seem) fair to them. And Allah guides not the disbelieving people."
"O ye who believe! what is the matter with you that, when it is said to you, go forth in the way of Allah, you sink heavily towards the earth? Would you be contented with the present life in preference to the Hereafter? But the enjoyment of the present life is but little, as compared with the Hereafter."
"If you do not go forth (to fight), He will punish you with a painful punishment, and will choose in your stead a people other than you, and you shall do Him no harm at all. And Allah has full power over all things."
"If you help him not, then (know that) Allah helped him (even) when the disbelievers drove him forth while he was one of the two when they were both in the cave, when he said to his companion, ‘Grieve not, for Allah is with us.’ Then Allah sent down His peace on him, and strengthened him with hosts which you did not see, and humbled the word of those who disbelieved, and it is the word of Allah alone which is supreme. And Allah is Mighty, Wise."
"Go forth, light and heavy, and strive with your property and your persons in the cause of Allah. That is better for you, if only you knew."
"If it had been an immediate gain and a short journey, they would certainly have followed thee, but the hard journey seemed too long to them. Yet they will swear by Allah, (saying), ‘If we had been able, we would surely have gone forth with you.’ They ruin their souls; and Allah knows that they are liars."
Allah remove thy (cares). Why didst thou permit them (to stay behind) until those who spoke the truth had become known to thee and (until) thou hadst known the liars?
Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day will not ask leave of thee (to be exempted) from striving with their property and their persons. And Allah well knows the righteous.
"Only those will ask leave of thee (to be exempted) who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day, and whose hearts are full of doubt, and in their doubt they waver."
"And if they had intended to go forth they would certainly have made some preparation for it; but Allah was averse to their marching forth. So He kept them back, and it was said: ‘Sit ye (at home) with those who sit.’"
"If they had gone forth with you, they would have added to you nothing but trouble, and would have hurried to and fro in your midst, seeking (to create) discord among  you. And there are among you those who would listen to them. And Allah well knows the wrongdoers."
"They sought (to create) disorder even before (this), and they devised plots against thee till the truth came and the purpose of Allah prevailed, though they did not like (it.)"
"And among them is he who says, ‘Permit me (to stay behind) and put me not to trial.’ Surely, they have already fallen into trial. And surely, Hell shall encompass the disbelievers."
"If good befall thee, it grieves them, but if a misfortune befall thee, they say, ‘We had indeed taken our precaution beforehand.’ And they turn away rejoicing."
"Say, ‘Nothing shall befall us save that which Allah has ordained for us. He is our Protector. And in Allah then should the believers put their trust.’"
"Say, ‘You do not await for us anything except one of the two good things; while as regards you, we await that Allah will afflict you with a punishment either from Himself or at our hands. Wait then; we (also) are waiting with you.’"
"Say, ‘Spend willingly or unwillingly, it shall not be accepted from you. You are indeed a disobedient people.’"
And nothing has deprived them of the acceptance of their contributions save that they disbelieve in Allah and His Messenger. And they come not to Prayer except lazily and they make no contribution save reluctantly.
So let not their wealth nor their children excite thy wonder. Allah only intends to punish them therewith in the present life and that their souls may depart while they are disbelievers.
"And they swear by Allah that they are indeed of you, while they are not of you, but they are a people who are timorous."
"If they could find a place of refuge, or caves, or (even) a hole to enter, they would surely turn thereto, rushing uncontrollably."
"And among them are those who find fault with thee in (the matter of) alms. If they are given thereof, they are content; but if they are not given thereof, behold! they are discontented."
"Had they but been content with what Allah and His Messenger had given them and said, ‘Sufficient for us is Allah; Allah will give us of His bounty, and so will His Messenger; to Allah do we turn in supplication,’ (it would have been better for them)."
"The alms are only for the poor and the needy, and for those employed in connection therewith, and for those whose hearts are to be reconciled, and for the (freeing of) slaves, and for those in debt, and for the cause of Allah, and for the wayfarer — an ordinance from Allah. And Allah is All-Knowing, Wise."
"And among them are those who annoy the Prophet and say, ‘He (gives) ear (to all).’ Say, ‘(His giving) ear (to all) is good for you; he believes in  Allah and believes the Faithful, and is a mercy for those of you who believe.’ And those who annoy the Messenger of Allah shall have a grievous punishment."
"They swear by Allah to you to please you; but Allah and His Messenger are more worthy that they should please him (and God), if they are believers."
"Have they not known that whoso opposes Allah and His Messenger, for him is the fire of Hell, wherein he shall abide? That is the great humiliation."
"The hypocrites fear lest a Surah should be revealed against them, informing them of what is in their hearts. Say, ‘Mock ye! surely, Allah will bring to light what you fear.’"
"And if thou question them, they will most surely say, ‘We were only talking idly and jesting.’ Say, ‘Was it Allah and His Signs and His Messenger that you mocked at?"
"‘Offer no excuse. You have certainly disbelieved after your believing. If We forgive a party from among you, a party shall We punish, for they have been guilty.’"
"The hypocrites, men and women, are (all connected) one with another. They enjoin evil and forbid good, and keep their hands closed. They neglected Allah, so He has neglected them. Surely, it is the hypocrites who are the disobedient."
"Allah promises the hypocrites, men and women, and the disbelievers the fire of Hell, wherein they shall abide. It will suffice them.  And Allah has cursed them. And they shall have a lasting punishment,"
"Even as those before you. They were mightier than you in power and richer in possessions and children. They enjoyed their lot for a short time, so have you enjoyed your lot as those before you enjoyed their lot. And you indulged in idle talk as they indulged in idle talk. It is they whose works shall be of no avail in this world and the Hereafter. And it is they who are the losers."
"Has not the story reached them of those before them — the people of Noah, ‘Ad, and Thamud, and the people of Abraham, and the dwellers of Midian, and the cities which were overthrown? Their Messengers came to them with clear Signs. So Allah would not wrong them, but they wronged themselves."
"And the believers, men and women, are friends one of another. They enjoin good and forbid evil and observe Prayer and pay the Zakat and obey Allah and His Messenger. It is these on whom Allah will have mercy. Surely, Allah is Mighty, Wise."
"Allah has promised to believers, men and women, Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide, and delightful dwellingplaces in Gardens of Eternity. And the pleasure of Allah is the greatest of all. That is the supreme triumph."
"O Prophet, strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites. And be severe to them. Their abode is Hell, and an evil destination it is."
"They swear by Allah that they said nothing, but they did certainly use blasphemous language, and disbelieved after they had embraced Islam. And they meditated that which they could not attain. And they cherished hatred only because Allah and His Messenger had enriched them out of His bounty. So if they repent, it will be better for them; but if they turn away, Allah will punish them with a grievous punishment in this world and the Hereafter, and they shall have neither friend nor helper in the earth."
"And among them there are those who made a covenant with Allah, (saying), ‘If He give us of His bounty, we would most surely give alms and be of the virtuous.’"
"But when He gave them of His bounty, they became niggardly of it, and they turned away in aversion."
"So He requited them with hypocrisy (which shall last) in their hearts until the day when they shall meet Him, because they broke their promise to Allah, and because they lied."
Know they not that Allah knows their secrets as well as their private counsels and that Allah is the Best Knower of all unseen things?
"Those who find fault with such of the believers as give alms of their own free will and with such as find nothing (to give) save (the earnings of) their toil. They thus deride them. Allah shall requite them for their derision, and for them is a grievous punishment."
"Ask thou forgiveness for them, or ask thou not forgiveness for them; even if thou ask forgiveness for them seventy times, Allah will never forgive them. That is because they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger. And Allah guides not the perfidious people."
"Those who were left behind rejoiced in their sitting (at home) behind (the back of) the Messenger of Allah, and were averse to striving with their property and their persons in the cause of Allah. And they said, ‘Go not forth in the heat.’ Say, ‘The fire of Hell is more intense in heat.’ Could they but understand!"
They must laugh little and weep much as a reward for that which they used to earn.
"And if Allah return thee to a party of them, and they ask of thee leave to go forth (to fight), say then, ‘You shall never go forth with me and shall never fight an enemy with me. You chose to sit (at home) the first time, so sit now with those who remain behind.’"
"And never pray thou for any of them that dies, nor stand by his grave; for they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger and died while they were disobedient."
And their possessions and their children should not excite thy wonder; Allah only intends to punish them therewith in this world and that their souls may depart while they are disbelievers.
"And when a Surah is revealed, (enjoining), ‘Believe in Allah and strive (in the cause of Allah) in company with His Messenger,’ those of them who possess affluence ask leave of thee and say, ‘Leave us that we be with those who sit (at home).’"
"They are content to be with the womenfolk, and their hearts are sealed so that they understand not."
"But the Messenger and those who believe with him strive (in the cause of Allah) with their property and their persons, and it is they who shall have good things, and it is they who shall prosper."
Allah has prepared for them Gardens underneath which flow rivers; therein they shall abide. That is the supreme triumph.
"And those who make excuses from among the desert Arabs, came that exemption might be granted them. And those who were false to Allah and His Messenger stayed (at home). A grievous punishment shall befall those of them who disbelieve."
"No blame lies on the weak, nor on the sick, nor on those who find naught to spend, if they are sincere to Allah and His Messenger. There is no cause of reproach against those who do good deeds; and Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"Nor against those to whom, when they came to thee that thou shouldst mount them, thou didst say, ‘I cannot find whereon I can mount you;’ they turned back, their eyes overflowing with tears, out of grief that they could not find what they might spend."
"The cause of reproach is only against those who ask leave of thee, while they are rich. They are content to be with the womenfolk. And Allah has set a seal upon their hearts so that they know not."
"They will make excuses to you when you return to them. Say, ‘Make no excuses; we will not believe you. Allah has already informed us of the facts about you. And Allah will observe your conduct, and (also) His Messenger; then you will be brought back to Him Who knows the unseen and the seen, and He will tell you all that you used to do.’"
"They will swear to you by Allah, when you return to them, that you may leave them alone. So leave them alone. Surely, they are an abomination, and their abode is Hell — a (fit) recompense for that which they used to earn."
"They will swear to you that you may be pleased with them. But (even) if you be pleased with them, Allah will not be pleased with the rebellious people."
"The Arabs of the desert are the worst in disbelief and hypocrisy, and most apt not to know the ordinances (of the Revelation) which Allah has sent down to His Messenger. And Allah is All-Knowing, Wise."
"And among the Arabs of the desert are those who regard that which they spend (for God) as a fine and they wait for calamities to (befall) you. On themselves shall fall an evil calamity. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
"And among the Arabs of the desert are those who believe in Allah and the Last Day and regard that which they spend as means of drawing near to Allah and (of receiving) the blessings of the Prophet. Aye! it is for them certainly a means of drawing near (to God). Allah will soon admit them to His mercy. Surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"And (as for) the foremost (among the believers), the first of the Emigrants and the Helpers, and those who followed them in the best possible manner, Allah is well pleased with them and they are well pleased with Him; and He has prepared for them Gardens beneath which flow rivers. They will abide therein for ever. That is the supreme triumph."
And of the desert Arabs around you (some) are hypocrites; and of the people of Medina (also). They persist in hypocrisy. Thou knowest them not; We know them. We will punish them twice; then shall they be given over to a great punishment.
"And (there are) others who have acknowledged their faults. They mixed a good work with another (that was) evil. It may be that Allah will turn to them with compassion. Surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"Take alms out of their wealth, so that thou mayest cleanse them and purify them thereby. And pray for them; thy prayer is indeed a (source of) tranquillity for them. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
"Know they not that Allah is He Who accepts repentance from His servants and takes alms, and that Allah is He Who is Oft-Returning (with compassion), (and is) Merciful?"
"And say, ‘Work, and Allah will surely see your work and (also) His Messenger and the believers. And you shall be brought back to Him Who knows the unseen and the seen; then He will tell you what you used to do.’"
"And (there are) others (whose) case has been postponed for the decree of Allah. He may punish them or He may turn to them with compassion. And Allah is All- Knowing, Wise."
"And (among the hypocrites are) those who have built a mosque in order to injure (Islam) and (help) disbelief and cause a division among the believers, and prepare an ambush for him who warred against Allah and His Messenger before (this). And they will surely swear: ‘We meant nothing but good;’ but Allah bears witness that they are certainly liars."
"Never stand (to pray) therein. A mosque which was founded upon piety from the (very) first day is surely more worthy that thou shouldst stand (to pray) therein. In it are men who love to become purified, and Allah loves those who purify themselves."
"Is he, then, who founded his building on fear of Allah and His pleasure better or he who founded his building on the brink of a tottering water-worn bank which tumbled down with him into the fire of Hell? And Allah guides not the wrongdoing people."
" (This) building of theirs, which they have built, will ever continue to be a (source of) disquiet in their hearts, unless their hearts be torn to pieces. And Allah is All-Knowing, Wise."
"Surely, Allah has purchased of the believers their persons and their property in return for the Garden they shall have; they fight in the cause of Allah, and they slay and are slain — a promise (that He has made) incumbent on Himself in the Torah, and the Gospel, and the Qur’an. And who is more faithful to his promise than Allah? Rejoice, then, in your bargain which you have made with Him; and that it is which is the supreme triumph."
" (They are) the ones who turn (to God in repentance), who worship (Him), who praise (Him), who go about in the land (serving Him), who bow down (to God), who prostrate themselves (in prayer), who enjoin good and forbid evil, and who watch the limits (set) by Allah. And give glad tidings to those who believe."
"It is not for the Prophet and those who believe that they should ask (of God) forgiveness for the idolaters, even though they may be kinsmen, after it has become plain to  them that they are the people of Hell."
"And Abraham’s asking forgiveness for his father was only because of a promise he had made to him, but when it became clear to him that he was an enemy to Allah, he dissociated himself from him. Surely, Abraham was most tender-hearted, forbearing."
"And it is not for Allah to cause a people to go astray after He has guided them until He makes clear to them that which they ought to guard against. Surely, Allah knows all things full well."
"Surely, it is Allah to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He gives life and causes death. And you have no friend nor helper beside Allah."
"Allah has certainly turned with mercy to the Prophet and (to) the Emigrants and the Helpers who followed him in the hour of distress after the hearts of a party of them had well-nigh swerved. He again turned to them with mercy. Surely, He is to them Compassionate, Merciful."
"And (He has turned with mercy) to the three whose (case) was deferred, until the earth became too strait for them with (all) its vastness, and their souls were (also) straitened for them, and they became convinced that there was no refuge from Allah save unto Himself. Then He turned to them with mercy that they might turn (to Him). Surely, it is Allah Who is Oft-Returning (with compassion and is) Merciful."
O ye who believe! fear Allah and be with the truthful.
"It was not proper for the people of Medina and those around them from among the Arabs of the desert that they should have remained behind the Messenger of Allah or that they should have preferred their own lives to his. That is because there distresses them neither thirst nor fatigue nor hunger in the way of Allah, nor do they tread a track which enrages the disbelievers, nor do they cause an enemy any injury whatsoever, but there is written down for them a good work on account of it. Surely, Allah suffers not the reward of those who do good to be lost."
"And they spend not any sum, small or great, nor do they traverse a valley, but it is written down for them, that Allah may give them the best reward for what they did."
"It is not possible for the believers to go forth all together. Why, then, does not a party from every section of them go forth that they may become well versed in religion, and that they may warn their people when they return to them, so that they may guard (against evil)?"
O ye who believe! fight such of the disbelievers as are near to you and let them find hardness in you; and know that Allah is with the righteous.
"And whenever a Surah is sent down, there are some of them who say: ‘Which of you has this (Surah) increased in faith?’ But, as to those who believe, it increases their faith and they rejoice."
"But as for those in whose hearts is a disease, it adds (further) filth to their (present) filth, and they die while they are disbelievers."
"Do they not see that they are tried every year once or twice? Yet they do not repent, nor would they be admonished."
"And whenever a Surah is sent down, they look at one another, (saying,) ‘Does any one see you?’ Then they turn away. Allah has turned away their hearts because they are a people who would not understand."
"Surely, a Messenger has come unto you from among yourselves; grievous to him is that you should fall into trouble; (he is) ardently desirous of your (welfare); (and) to the believers (he is) compassionate, merciful."
"But if they turn away, say, ‘Allah is sufficient for me. There is no God but He. In Him do I put my trust, and He is the Lord of the mighty Throne."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
Alif Lam Ra. These are the verses of the Book that is full of wisdom.
"Is it a (matter of) wonder for men that We have inspired a man from among them, (saying), ‘Warn mankind and give glad tidings to those who believe that they have a true rank (of honour) with their Lord?’ The disbelievers say, ‘Surely, this is a manifest enchanter.’"
"Verily, your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six periods, then He settled Himself on the Throne; He governs everything. There is no intercessor (with Him) save after His permission. That is Allah, your Lord, so worship Him. Will you not, then, be admonished?"
"To Him shall you all return. The promise of Allah is true. Surely, He originates the creation; then He reproduces it, that He may reward those who believe and do good works, with equity; and (as for) those who disbelieve, they shall have a drink of boiling water, and a painful punishment, because they disbelieved."
"He it is Who made the sun (radiate) a brilliant light and the moon (reflect) a lustre, and ordained for it stages, that you might know the number of  years and the reckoning (of time). Allah has not created this but in truth. He details the Signs for a people who have knowledge."
"Verily, in the alternation of night and day, and in all that Allah has created in the heavens and the earth there are Signs for a God-fearing people."
"Those who look not for the meeting with Us and are content with the life of this world and feel at rest therewith, and those who are heedless of Our Signs — "
"It is these whose abode in Fire, because of what they earned."
"But (as for) those who believe, and do good works — their Lord will guide them because of their faith. Rivers shall flow beneath them in the Gardens of Bliss."
"Their prayer therein shall be, ‘Glory be to Thee, O Allah!’ and their greeting therein shall be, ‘Peace.’ And the conclusion of their prayer shall be, ‘All praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.’"
"And if Allah were to hasten for men the ill (they have earned) as they would hasten on the (acquisition of) wealth, (the end of) their term (of life) would have been already brought upon them. But We leave those who look not for the meeting with Us to wander distractedly in their transgression."
"And when trouble befalls a man, he calls on Us, lying on his side, or sitting, or standing; but when We have removed his trouble from him,  he goes his way as though he had never called on Us for the (removal of the) trouble that befell him. Thus it is that the doings of the extravagant are given a fair appearance in their eyes."
"And We destroyed the generations before you when they did wrong; and there came to them their Messengers with clear Signs, but they would not believe. Thus do We requite the guilty people."
"Then, We made you (their) successors in the earth after them, that We might see how you would act."
"And when Our clear Signs are recited unto them, those who look not for the meeting with Us say, ‘Bring a Qur’an other than this or change it.’ Say, ‘It is not for me to change it of my own accord. I only follow what is revealed to me. Indeed, I fear, if I disobey my Lord, the punishment of an awful day.’"
"Say, ‘If Allah had (so) willed, I should not have recited it to you nor would He have made it known to you. I have indeed lived among you a (whole) lifetime before this. Will you not then understand?’"
"Who is then more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah or (he) who treats His Signs as lies? Surely, the guilty shall never prosper."
"And they worship, instead of Allah, that which neither harms them nor profits them; and they say, ‘These are our intercessors with Allah.’ Say, ‘Would you inform  Allah of something He knows not in the heavens or in the earth?’ Holy is He, and high exalted above (all) that which they associate (with Him)."
"And mankind were but one community, then they differed (among themselves); and had it not been for a word that had gone before from thy Lord, it would have (already) been judged between them concerning that in which they differed."
"And they say, ‘Why has not a Sign been sent down to him from his Lord?’ Say, ‘The unseen belongs only to Allah. So wait; I am with you among those who wait.’"
"And when We make people taste of mercy after adversity has touched them, behold, they begin to plan against Our Signs. Say, ‘Allah is swifter in planning.’ Surely, Our messengers write down all that you plan."
"He it is Who enables you to journey through land and sea until, when you are on (board) the ships and they sail with them with a fair breeze and they rejoice in it, there overtakes them (the ships) a violent wind and the waves come on them from every side and they think they are encompassed, (then) they call upon Allah, purifying (their) religion for Him, (saying), ‘If Thou deliver us from this, we will surely be of the thankful.’"
"But when He has delivered them, lo! they begin to commit excesses in the earth wrongfully. O ye men, your excesses are only against your own selves. (Have) the enjoyment of the present life. Then to Us shall be your return; and We will inform you of what you used to do."
"The likeness of the present life is only as water which We send down from the clouds, then there mingles with it the produce of the earth, of which men and cattle eat till, when the earth receives its ornature and looks beautiful and its owners think that they have power over it, there comes to it Our command by night or by day and We render it a field that is mown down, as if nothing had existed there the day before. Thus do We expound the Signs for a people who reflect."
"And Allah calls to the abode of peace, and guides whom He pleases to the straight path."
"For those who do good deeds, there shall be the best (reward) and (yet) more (blessings). And neither darkness nor ignominy shall cover their faces. It is these who are the inmates of Heaven; therein shall they abide."
"And (as for) those who do evil deeds, the punishment of an evil shall be the like thereof, and ignominy shall cover them. They shall have none to protect them against Allah. (And they shall look) as if their faces had been covered with dark patches of night. It is these who are  the inmates of the Fire; therein shall they abide."
"And (remember) the day when We shall gather them all together, then shall We say to those who ascribed partners (to God), “(Stand back in) your places, you and your ‘partners’”. Then We shall separate them widely, one from another, and their ‘partners’ will say: ‘It was not us that you worshipped."
‘So Allah is (now) sufficient as a Witness between us and you. We were certainly unaware of your worship.’
"There shall every soul realize what it shall have sent on before. And they shall be brought back to Allah, their true Master, and all that they used to forge shall be lost to them."
"Say, ‘Who provides sustenance for you from the heaven and the earth? Or who is it that has power over the ears and the eyes? And who brings forth the living from the dead and brings the dead out of the living? And who governs all affairs?’ They will say, ‘Allah’. Then say, ‘Will you not then seek (His) protection?’"
"Such is Allah, your true Lord. So what (would you have) after (discarding) the truth except error? How then are you being turned away (from the truth)?"
"Thus is the word of thy Lord proved true against those who rebel,  that they believe not."
"Say, ‘Is there any of your associate- gods who originates creation and then reproduces it?’ Say, ‘It is Allah (alone) Who originates creation and then reproduces it. Whither then are you turned away?’"
"Say, ‘Is there any of your associate- gods who leads to the truth?’ Say, ‘It is Allah Who leads to the truth. Is then He Who leads to the truth more worthy to be followed or he who finds not the way (himself) unless he be guided? What, then, is the matter with you? How judge ye?’"
"And most of them follow nothing but conjecture. Surely, conjecture avails nothing against truth. Verily, Allah is well aware of what they do."
"And this Qur’an is not such as might be devised by any one except Allah. On the contrary, it fulfils that which is before it and is an exposition of the Law (of God). There is no doubt about it. (It is) from the Lord of the worlds."
"Do they say, ‘He has forged it?’ Say, ‘Bring then a Surah like unto it, and call for help on all you can besides Allah, if you are truthful.’"
"Nay, but they have rejected that the knowledge of which they did not encompass nor has the (true) significance thereof yet come to them. In like manner did those before them reject (the truth). But see what was the end of those who did wrong!"
"And of them there are (some) who believe therein, and of them there are (others) who do not believe  therein, and thy Lord well knows those who act corruptly."
"And if they accuse thee of lying, say, ‘For me is my work and for you is your work. You are not responsible for what I do and I am not responsible for what you do.’"
"And among them are (some) who give ear to thee. But canst thou make the deaf hear, even though they understand not?"
"And among them are (some) who look towards thee. But canst thou guide the blind, even though they see not?"
"Certainly, Allah wrongs not men at all, but men wrong their own souls."
"And on the day when He will gather them together, (it will appear to them) as though they had not tarried in the world save for an hour of a day. They will recognize one another. Losers indeed are those who deny the meeting with Allah and would not follow guidance."
"And if We show thee (in thy lifetime the fulfilment of) some of the things with which We have threatened them, (thou wilt know it); or if We cause thee to die (before that), then to Us is their return, (and thou wilt see the fulfilment in the next world); and Allah is Witness to all that they do."
"And for every people there is a Messenger. So when their Messenger comes, it is judged between them with equity, and they are not wronged."
"And they say, ‘When will this promise be (fulfilled), if you are truthful?’"
"Say, ‘I have no power for myself over any harm or benefit, save that which Allah wills. For every (disbelieving) people there is an appointed term. When their term is come, they cannot remain behind a single moment, nor can they get ahead (of it).’"
"Say, ‘Tell me, if His punishment comes upon you by night or by day, how will the guilty run away from it?"
‘Is it then when it has befallen you that you will believe in it? What! Now! And (before this) you used to demand its speedy coming?’
"Then will it be said to those who did wrong, ‘Taste ye the abiding punishment. You are not requited save for that which you used to earn.’"
"And they enquire of thee, ‘Is it true?’ Say, ‘Yea, by my Lord! It is most surely true; and you cannot frustrate (it).’"
"And if every soul that does wrong possessed all that is in the earth, it would surely offer to ransom (itself) therewith. And they will conceal (their) remorse when they see the punishment. And judgment shall be passed between them with equity, and they shall not be wronged."
"Know ye! to Allah, surely, belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. Know ye, that Allah’s promise is surely true! But most of them understand not."
"He it is Who gives life and causes death, and to Him shall you be brought back."
"O mankind! there has indeed come to you an exhortation from your Lord and a cure for whatever (disease) there is in the hearts, and a guidance and a mercy to the believers."
"Say, ‘(All this is) through the grace of Allah and through His mercy; therein, therefore, let them rejoice. That is better than what they hoard.’"
"Say, ‘Have you considered that Allah sent down provision to you, then you made (some) of it unlawful and (some) lawful?’ Say, ‘Has Allah permitted you (that) or do you invent lies against Allah?’"
"What think those who invent lies against Allah of the Day of Resurrection? Surely, Allah is gracious towards mankind, but most of them are not thankful."
"And thou art not engaged in anything, and thou recitest not from Him any portion of the Qur’an, and you do no work, but We are witnesses of you when you are engrossed therein. And there is not hidden from thy Lord even an atom’s weight in the earth or in heaven. And there is nothing smaller than that or greater, but it is (recorded) in a clear Book."
"Behold! the friends of Allah shall certainly have no fear, nor shall they grieve — "
Those who believed and kept to righteousness — 
For them are glad tidings in the present life and (also) in the Hereafter — there is no changing the words of Allah; that indeed is the supreme triumph.
"And let not their words grieve thee. Surely, all power belongs to Allah. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing."
"Behold! whoever is in the heavens and whoever is in the earth is Allah’s. Those who call on others than Allah do not (really) follow (these) ‘partners’; they follow only a conjecture, and they do nothing but guess."
"He it is Who has made for you the night (dark) that you may rest therein, and the day full of light. Surely, therein are Signs for a people who listen."
"They say, ‘Allah has taken unto Himself a son.’ Holy is He! He is Self-Sufficient. To Him belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth. You have no authority for this. Do you say against Allah what you know not?"
"Say, ‘Those who invent a lie against Allah shall not prosper.’"
" (They will have some) enjoyment in this world. Then to Us is their return. Then shall We make them taste a severe punishment, because they used to disbelieve."
"And recite unto them the story of Noah, when he said to his people, ‘O my people, if my station (with God) and my reminding you (of your duty) through the Signs of Allah offend you — and in Allah do I put my trust — muster then (all) your designs, (you) and your ‘partners’; then let not your course of action be obscure to you; then carry out (your designs) against me and give me no respite."
"‘But if you turn back, (remember), I have not asked of you any reward. My reward is with Allah alone, and I have been commanded to be of those who are resigned (to Him).’"
"But they rejected him, so We saved him and those who were with him in the Ark. And We made them inheritors (of Our favours), while We drowned those who rejected Our Signs. See then, how was the end of those who had been warned!"
"Then We sent, after him, (other) Messengers to their (respective) peoples, and they brought them clear proofs. But they would not believe (in them), because they had rejected them before. Thus do We seal the hearts of transgressors."
"Then did We send, after them, Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his chiefs with Our Signs, but they behaved arrogantly. And they were a sinful people."
"And when there came to them the truth from Us, they said, ‘This is surely a manifest enchantment.’"
"Moses said, ‘Do you say (this) of the truth when it has come to you? Is this enchantment? And the enchanters never prosper.’"
"They said, ‘Hast thou come to us that thou mayest turn us away from what we found our fathers following, and that you two may have greatness in the land? But we will not believe in either of you.’"
"And Pharaoh said, ‘Bring to me every expert magician.’"
"And when the magicians came, Moses said to them, ‘Cast ye what you would cast.’"
"And when they had cast, Moses said, ‘What you have brought is (mere) sorcery. Surely, Allah will make it vain. Verily, Allah does not allow the work of mischief-makers to prosper."
"‘And Allah establishes the truth by His words, even though the sinners be averse (to it).’"
"And none obeyed Moses save some youths from among his people, because of the fear of Pharaoh and their chiefs, lest he should persecute them. And of a truth, Pharaoh was a tyrant in the land and surely he was of the transgressors."
"And Moses said, ‘O my people, if you have believed in Allah, then in Him put your trust, if you indeed submit (to His will).’"
"And they said, ‘In Allah do we put our trust. Our Lord, make us not a trial for the wrongdoing people."
‘And deliver us by Thy mercy from the disbelieving people.’
"And We spoke to Moses and his brother, (saying), ‘Take, ye twain, (some) houses for your people in (the) town, and make your houses so as to face one another, and observe Prayer. And give glad tidings to the believers.’"
"And Moses said, ‘Our Lord, Thou hast bestowed upon Pharaoh and his chiefs embellishment and wealth in the present life, with the result, our Lord, that they are leading (men) astray from Thy path. Our Lord! destroy their riches and attack their hearts — and they are not going to believe until they see the grievous punishment.’"
"He said, ‘Your prayer is accepted. So be ye twain steadfast, and follow not the path of those who know not.’"
"And We brought the children of Israel across the sea; and Pharaoh and his hosts pursued them wrongfully and aggressively, till, when (the calamity of) drowning overtook him, he said, ‘I believe that there is no  God but He in Whom the children of Israel believe, and I am of those who submit (to Him).’"
What! Now! while thou wast disobedient before (this) and wast of those who create disorder.
"So this day We will save thee in thy body (alone) that thou mayest be a Sign to those (who come) after thee. And surely, many of mankind are heedless of Our Signs."
"And We assigned to the children of Israel an excellent abode, and We provided them with good things, and they differed not until there came to them the knowledge. Surely, thy Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that in which they differed."
"And if thou art in doubt concerning that which We have sent down to thee, ask those who have been reading the Book before thee. Indeed the truth has come to thee from thy Lord; be not, therefore, of those who doubt."
"And be not thou of those who reject the Signs of Allah, or thou shalt be of the losers."
"Surely, those against whom the word of thy Lord has taken effect will not believe,"
"Even if there come to them every Sign, till they see the grievous punishment."
"Why was there no (other) people, save the people of Jonah, who should have believed so that their belief would have profited them? When they believed, We removed from them the punishment of disgrace in the present life, and We gave them provision for a while."
"And if thy Lord had (enforced) His will, surely, all who are on the earth would have believed together. Wilt thou, then, force men to become believers?"
And no soul can believe except by the permission of Allah. And He makes (His) wrath (descend) on those who will not use their reason.
"Say, ‘Consider what is (happening) in the heavens and the earth.’ But Signs and Warners avail not a people who will not believe."
"What then do they expect save the like of the days of (punishment suffered by) those who passed away before them? Say, ‘Wait then, (and) I am with you among those who wait.’"
Then shall We save Our Messengers and those who believe. Thus (does it always happen); it is incumbent on Us to save believers.
"Say, “O ye men, if you are in doubt as to my religion, then (know that) I worship not those whom you worship beside Allah, but I worship Allah (alone) Who causes you to die, and I have been commanded to be of the believers,"
"“And (I have also been commanded to say): ‘Set thy face toward religion as one ever inclined (to God), and be not thou of those who ascribe partners (to Him)."
"‘And call not, beside Allah, on any other that can neither profit thee nor harm thee. And if thou didst so, thou wouldst then certainly be of the wrongdoers.’”"
"And if Allah touch thee with harm, there is none who can remove it but He: and if He desire good for thee, there is none who can repel His grace. He causes it to reach whomsoever of His servants He wills. And He is the Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"Say, ‘O ye men, now has the truth come to you from your Lord. So whosoever follows the guidance, follows it only for the good of his own soul, and whosoever errs, errs only against it. And I am not a keeper over you.’"
And follow that which is revealed to thee and be steadfast until Allah give His judgment. And He is the Best of judges.
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"Alif Lam Ra. (This is) a Book whose verses have been made unchangeable (and) then they have been expounded in detail. (It is) from One Wise, (and) All-Aware."
" (It teaches) that you should worship none but Allah. I am to you a Warner, and a bearer of glad tidings from Him;"
"And that you seek forgiveness of your Lord, (and) then turn to Him. He will provide for you a goodly provision until an appointed term. And He will grant His grace to every one possessed of merit. And if you turn away, then surely, I fear for you the punishment of a dreadful day."
To Allah is your return; and He has power over all things.
"Now surely, they fold up their breasts that they may hide themselves from Him. Aye, (even) when they cover themselves with their garments, He knows what they conceal and what they reveal. Surely, He is well aware of what is in (their) breasts."
And there is no creature that moves in the earth but it is for Allah to provide it with sustenance. And He knows its lodging and its home. All (this) is (recorded) in a clear Book.
"And He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six periods, and His throne rests on water, that He might prove you (to show) which of you is best in conduct. And if thou say, ‘You shall surely be raised after death,’ those who disbelieve will certainly say, ‘This is nothing but clear deception.’"
"And if We put off their punishment until a reckoned time, they would certainly say, ‘What withholds it?’ Now surely, on the day that it shall come unto them, it shall not be averted from them, and that which they used to mock at shall encompass them."
"And if We make man taste of mercy from Us, and then take it away from him, verily, he is despairing, ungrateful."
"And if after an adversity has touched him We cause him to taste of prosperity, he will assuredly say, ‘Gone are the ills from me.’ Lo! he is exultant, boastful;"
Save those who are steadfast and do good works. It is they who will have forgiveness and a great reward.
" (They imagine that) thou art now perhaps going to abandon part of that which has been revealed to thee; and thy bosom is becoming straitened thereby because they say, ‘Wherefore has not a treasure been sent down to him or an angel come with him?’ Verily, thou art only a Warner, and Allah is Guardian over all things."
"Do they say, ‘He has forged it?’ Say, ‘Then bring ten Chapters like it, forged, and call on whom you can beside Allah, if you are truthful.’"
"And if they do not respond to you, then know that it has been revealed (replete) with Allah’s knowledge and that there is no God but He. Will you then submit?"
"Whoso desires the present life and its embellishment, We will fully repay them for their works in this (life) and they shall not be wronged therein."
"Those are they who shall have nothing in the Hereafter save the Fire, and that which they wrought in this (life) shall come to naught, and vain shall be that which they used to do."
"Can he, then, who possesses a clear proof from his Lord, and (to testify to whose truth) a witness from Him shall follow him, and who was preceded by the Book of Moses, a guide and a mercy, (be an impostor)? Those (who consider these matters) believe therein, and whoever of the (opposing) parties disbelieves in it, Fire shall be his promised place. So be not thou in doubt about it. Surely, it is the truth from thy Lord; but most men do not believe."
"And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah? Such shall be presented before their Lord,  and the witnesses will say, ‘These are they who lied against their Lord.’ Now surely, the curse of Allah is on the unjust:"
Who turn (men) away from the path of Allah and seek to make it crooked. And these it is who disbelieve in the Hereafter.
"Such can never frustrate (God)’(s plans) in the land, nor have they any friends beside Allah. Punishment will be doubled for them. They can neither hear, nor can they see."
"It is these who have ruined their souls, and that which they fabricated shall fail them."
"Undoubtedly, it is they who shall be the greatest losers in the Hereafter."
"Verily, those who believe and do good works, and humble themselves before their Lord — these are the inmates of Heaven; therein shall they abide."
"The case of the two parties is like (that of) the blind and the deaf, and the seeing and the hearing. Is the case of the two alike? Will you not then understand?"
"And We sent Noah to his people, (and he said), ‘Truly, I am a plain Warner to you,"
"‘That you worship none but Allah. Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a grievous day.’"
"The chiefs of his people, who disbelieved, replied, ‘We see in thee nothing but a man like ourselves, and we see that none have followed thee but those who, to all outward appearance, are the meanest of us. And we do not see in you any superiority over us;  nay, we believe you to be liars.’"
"He said, “O my people, tell me: if I stand on a clear proof from my Lord and He has bestowed upon me from Himself a great mercy which has been rendered obscure to you, shall we force it upon you, while you are averse thereto?"
"“And O my people, I ask not of you any wealth in return for it. My reward is due from Allah alone. And I am not going to drive away those who believe. They shall certainly meet their Lord. But I consider you to be a people who act ignorantly."
"“And O my people, who would help me against Allah, if I were to drive them away? Will you not then consider?"
"“And I say not to you, ‘I possess the treasures of Allah,’ nor do I know the unseen, nor say I, ‘I am an angel.’ Nor say I concerning those whom your eyes despise, ‘Allah will not bestow any good upon them’ — Allah knows best whatever is in their minds — Surely, I should then be of the unjust.”"
"They said, ‘O Noah, thou hast indeed disputed with us (long) and hast disputed with us many a time; bring us now that with which thou threatenest us, if thou art of those who speak the truth.’"
"He said, ‘Allah alone will bring it to you, if He please, and you cannot frustrate (God)’(s purpose)."
‘And my advice will profit you not if I desire to advise you. if Allah intends to destroy you. He is your Lord and to Him shall you be made to return.’
"Do they say, ‘He has forged it?’ Say, ‘If I have forged it, on me be my sin and I am clear of the sins you commit.’"
"And it was revealed to Noah, ‘None of thy people will believe except those who have already believed; grieve not therefore at what they have been doing."
‘And build thou the Ark under Our eyes and (as commanded by) Our revelation. And address not Me concerning the wrongdoers. They are surely going to be drowned.’
"And he was making the Ark; and every time the chiefs of his people passed by him, they mocked at him. He said, ‘If (now) you mock at us, (the time is coming when) we shall mock at you even just as you mock (now)."
"‘Then you shall know who it is on whom will come a punishment that will disgrace him, and on whom will fall a lasting punishment.’"
"Till, when Our command came and the fountains (of the earth) gushed forth, We said, ‘Embark therein two of every kind, male and female, and thy family, except those against whom the word has already gone forth, and those who believe.’ And there did not believe (and live) with him except a few."
"And he said, ‘Embark therein. In the name of Allah be its course and its mooring. My Lord is assuredly Most Forgiving, Merciful.’"
"And it moved along with them on waves like mountains. And Noah cried unto his son, while he was (keeping) apart, ‘O my son, embark with us and be not with the disbelievers.’"
"He replied, ‘I shall soon betake myself to a mountain which will shelter me from the water.’ He said, ‘There is no shelter (for anyone) this day, from the decree of Allah, excepting those to whom He shows mercy.’ And the wave came in between the two; so he was among the drowned."
"And it was said, ‘O earth, swallow thy water, and O sky, cease (raining).’ And the water was made to subside and the matter was ended. And (the Ark) came to rest on al-Judi. And it was said, ‘Cursed be the wrongdoing people.’"
"And Noah cried unto his Lord and said: ‘My Lord, verily, my son is of my family, and surely, Thy promise is true, and Thou art the Most Just of judges.’"
"He said: ‘O Noah, he is surely not of thy family; he is indeed (a man of) unrighteous conduct. So ask not of Me that of which thou hast no knowledge. I advise thee lest thou become (one) of the ignorant.’"
"He said: ‘My Lord, I beg Thee to protect me from asking Thee that whereof I have no knowledge. And unless Thou forgive me and have mercy on me, I shall be among the losers.’"
"It was said, ‘O Noah, descend (then) with peace from Us and blessings upon thee and upon peoples (to be born) of those with thee. And there will be (other) peoples whom We shall grant provision (for a time), then shall a grievous punishment touch them from Us.’"
"This is of the tidings of the unseen which We reveal to thee. Thou didst not know them, neither thou nor thy people, before this. So be thou patient; for the end is for the God-fearing."
"And to ‘Ad (We sent) their brother Hud. He said, ‘O my people, worship Allah (alone). You have no God beside Him. You are but forgers of lies."
"‘O my people, I do not ask of you any reward therefor. My reward is not due except from Him Who created me. Will you not then understand?"
"‘And O my people, ask forgiveness of your Lord, then turn to Him, He will send over you clouds pouring down abundant rain, and will add strength to your strength. And turn not away sinners.’"
"They said, ‘O Hud, thou hast not brought us any clear proof, and we are not going to forsake our gods (merely) because of thy saying, nor are we going to believe in thee."
"‘We can only say that some of our gods have visited thee with evil.’ He replied, ‘Surely, I call Allah to witness, and do ye also bear witness that I am clear of that which you associate as partners (with God)"
"‘Beside Him. So devise plans against me, all (of you), and give me no respite."
"‘I have indeed put my trust in Allah, my Lord and your Lord. There is no creature that moves (on the earth) but He holds it by the forelock. Surely, my Lord (stands) on the straight path."
"‘If then, you turn away, I have already conveyed to you that with which I have been sent to you, and my Lord will make another people take your place. And you cannot harm Him at all. Surely, my Lord is Guardian over all things.’"
"And when Our command came, We saved Hud and those who believed with him, by Our (special) mercy. And We saved them from a severe torment."
And these were ‘Ad. They denied the Signs of their Lord and disobeyed His Messengers and followed the bidding of every haughty enemy (of truth).
"And a curse was made to follow them in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection. Behold! (the tribe of) ‘Ad behaved ungratefully to their Lord. Behold! cursed are ‘Ad, the people of Hud!"
"And to (the tribe of) Thamud (We send) their brother Salih. He said, ‘O my people worship Allah; you have no God but Him. He raised you up from the earth, and settled you therein. So ask forgiveness of Him, then turn to Him (whole-heartedly). Verily, my Lord is nigh, (and) answers (prayers).’"
"They said, ‘O Salih, thou wast among us one in whom we placed our hopes. Dost thou forbid us to worship what our fathers worshipped? And we are surely in disquieting doubt concerning that to which thou callest us.’"
"He said, ‘O my people, tell me: if I stand on a clear proof from my Lord, and He has granted me mercy from Himself, who then will help me against Allah, if I disobey Him? So you will not but add to my destruction."
"‘And O my people, this is the she-camel of Allah as a Sign for you, so let her alone that she may feed in Allah’s earth, and touch her not with harm lest a near punishment seize you.’"
"But they hamstrung her; then he said, ‘Enjoy yourselves in your houses for three days. This is a promise which is not a lie.’"
"So when Our command came, we saved Salih and those who believed with him by Our (special) mercy, and (We saved them) from the ignominy of that day. Surely, thy Lord is Powerful, Mighty."
"And punishment overtook those who had done wrong, and they lay prostrate in their houses,"
As though they had never dwelt therein. Behold! Thamud behaved ungratefully to their Lord; Behold! cursed are (the tribe of) Thamud.
"And surely, Our messengers came to Abraham with glad tidings. They said, ‘(We bid you) peace.’ He answered, ‘Peace (be on you),’ and was not long in bringing a roasted calf."
"But when he saw their hands not reaching thereto, he knew not what they were, and conceived a fear of them. They said, ‘Fear not, for we have been sent to the people of Lot.’"
"And his wife was standing (by), and she (too) was frightened, whereupon We gave her glad tidings of the birth of Isaac and, after Isaac, of Jacob."
"She said, ‘Oh, woe is me! Shall I bear a child when I am an old woman, and this my husband is an old man? This is indeed a strange thing!’"
"They said, ‘Dost thou wonder at Allah’s decree? The mercy of Allah and His blessings are upon you, O people of the House. Surely, He is Praiseworthy, Glorious.’"
"And when fear left Abraham, and the glad tidings came to him, he began disputing with Us about the people of Lot."
"Indeed, Abraham was clement, tender-hearted, and oft-turning (to God)."
"‘O Abraham, turn away from this. Surely, the command of thy Lord has gone forth, and surely, there is coming to them a punishment that cannot be averted.’"
"And when Our messengers came to Lot, he was grieved on account of them and felt helpless on their behalf and said, ‘This is a distressful day.’"
"And his people came running towards him, trembling (with rage); and before this (too) they used to do evil. He said, ‘O my people, these are my daughters; they are purer for you. So fear Allah and disgrace me not in the presence of my guests. Is there not among you any rightminded man?’"
"They answered, ‘Thou surely knowest that we have no claim on thy daughters, and thou surely knowest what we desire.’"
"He said, ‘Would that I had power (to deal) with you, or I should betake myself to a mighty support (for shelter).’"
" (The messengers) said, ‘O Lot, we are the messengers of thy Lord. They shall by no means reach thee. So depart with thy family in a part of the night, and let none of you look back, but thy wife. Surely, what is going to befall them shall (also) befall her. Verily, their appointed time is the morning. Is not the morning nigh?’"
"So when Our command came, We turned that (town) upside down and We rained upon it stones of clay, layer upon layer,"
Marked (for them) in the decree of thy Lord. And such (punishment) is not far from the wrongdoers (of the present age).
"And to Midian (We sent) their brother Shu‘aib. He said, ‘O my people, worship Allah. You have no God other than Him. And give not short measure and short weight. I see you in (a state of) prosperity and I fear for you the punishment of a destructive day."
"‘And O my people, give full measure and full weight with equity, and defraud not people of their things and commit not iniquity in the earth, causing disorder."
"‘That which is left (with you) by Allah is better for you, if you are believers. And I am not a keeper over you.’"
"They replied, ‘O Shu‘aib, does thy Prayer bid thee that we should leave what our fathers worshipped,  or that we cease to do with our property what we please? Thou art (indeed) very intelligent (and) rightminded.’"
"He said, ‘O my people, tell me: if I stand on a clear evidence from my Lord, and He has provided me from Himself with a handsome provision, (what answer will you give to Him)? And I do not desire to do against you the (very) thing which I ask you not to do. I only desire reform as far as I can. There is no power in me save through Allah. In Him do I trust and to Him do I return."
"‘And O my people, let not (your) hostility towards me lead you (to this) that there should befall you the like of that which befell the people of Noah or the people of Hud or the people of Salih; and the people of Lot are not far from you."
"‘And seek forgiveness of your Lord; then turn to Him (wholeheartedly). Verily, my Lord is Merciful, Most Loving.’"
"They replied, ‘O Shu‘aib, we do not understand much of that which thou sayest, and surely, we see that thou art weak among us. And were it not for thy tribe, we would surely stone thee. And thou holdest no strong position among us.’"
"He said, ‘O my people, is my tribe mightier with you than Allah? And you have cast Him behind your backs as neglected. Surely, my Lord encompasses all that you do."
"‘And O my people, act as best you can, I (too) am acting. You will soon know on whom lights a punishment that will disgrace him, and who it is that is a liar. And wait; surely, I wait with you.’"
"And when Our command came, We saved Shu‘aib and those who had believed with him by Our (special) mercy; and chastisement seized those who had done wrong, so that they lay prostrate in their houses,"
"As though they had never dwelt therein. Behold! how Midian was cut off, even as Thamud had been cut off."
"And, surely, We sent Moses with Our Signs and manifest authority"
"To Pharaoh and his chiefs; but they followed the command of Pharaoh, and the command of Pharaoh was not at all rightful."
"He will go before his people on the Day of Resurrection and will bring them down into the Fire, (even as cattle are brought to a wateringplace). And evil is the wateringplace arrived at."
And a curse was made to follow them in this (life) and on the Day of Resurrection. Evil is the gift which shall be given (them).
"That is of the tidings of the (ruined) cities, We relate it to thee. Of them (some) are standing and (some) have been mown down (like the harvest)."
"And We did not wrong them, but they wronged themselves; and their gods on whom they called beside Allah were of no avail to them at all when the command of thy Lord came; and they added to them naught but perdition."
"Such is the grasp of thy Lord when He seizes the cities while they are doing wrong. Surely, His grasp is grievous (and) severe."
In that surely is a Sign for him who fears the punishment of the Hereafter. That is a day for which (all) mankind shall be gathered together and that is a day (the proceedings of) which shall be witnessed (by all).
And We delay it not save for a computed term.
"The day it comes, no soul shall speak except by His permission; then (some) of them will prove unfortunate and (others) fortunate."
"As for those who will prove unfortunate, they shall be in the Fire, wherein there shall be for them sighing and sobbing,"
"Abiding therein so long as the heavens and the earth endure, excepting what thy Lord may will. Surely, thy Lord does bring about what He pleases."
"But as for those who will prove fortunate, they shall be in Heaven; abiding therein so long as the heavens and the earth endure, excepting what thy Lord may will —  a gift that shall not be cut off."
"So be not in doubt concerning that which these (people) worship. They only worship as their fathers worshipped before, and We shall surely pay them in full their portion undiminished."
"And We certainly gave Moses the Book, but differences were created therein; and had it not been for a word already gone forth from thy Lord, surely, the matter would have been decided between them (long before); and (now) these (people) are in a disquieting doubt concerning it."
"And surely, (the works of) all (these have) not yet (been requited but) thy Lord will certainly repay them in full, according to their works. He is surely well aware of all that they do."
"So stand thou upright, as thou hast been commanded, and (also) those who have turned (to God) with thee; and exceed ye not the bounds, (O believers); (for) surely, He sees what you do."
"And incline not toward those who do wrong, lest the Fire touch you. And you shall have no friends beside Allah, nor shall you be helped."
"And observe Prayer at the two ends of the day, and in the hours of the night (that are nearer the day). Surely, good works drive away evil works. This is a reminder for those who would remember."
"And be thou steadfast; for surely, Allah suffers not the reward of the righteous to perish."
"Why, then, were there not among the generations before you persons possessed of understanding who would have forbidden corruption in the earth — except a few of those whom We saved from among them? But the wrongdoers followed that by which they were afforded ease and comfort, and they became guilty."
And thy Lord would not destroy the cities unjustly while the people thereof were righteous.
"And if thy Lord had (enforced) His will, He would have surely made mankind one people; but they would not cease to differ,"
"Save those on whom thy Lord has had mercy, and for this has He created them. But the word of thy Lord shall be fulfilled: ‘Verily, I will fill Hell with (the disobedient) Jinn and men all together.’"
"And all of the tidings of the Messengers, whereby We make thy heart firm, We relate unto thee. And herein has come to thee the truth and an exhortation and a reminder for believers."
"And say to those who believe not: ‘Act as best you can, we (too) are acting."
"‘And wait ye, we (too) are waiting.’"
"And to Allah belongs the hidden things of the heavens and the earth, and to Him shall the whole affair be referred. So worship Him and put thy trust in Him (alone). And thy Lord is not unmindful of what you do."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
Alif Lam Ra. These are verses of the clear Book.
We have revealed it — the Qur’an in Arabic — that you may understand.
"We narrate unto thee the most beautiful narration by revealing to thee this Qur’an, though thou wast, before this, of those not possessed of (requisite) knowledge."
" (Remember the time) when Joseph said to his father, ‘O my father, I saw (in a dream) eleven stars and the sun and the moon, I saw them making obeisance to me.’"
"He said, ‘O my darling son, relate not thy dream to thy brothers, lest they contrive a plot against thee; for Satan is to man an open enemy."
"‘And thus (shall it be as thou hast seen), thy Lord will choose thee and teach thee the interpretation of things and perfect His favour upon thee and upon the family of Jacob as He perfected it upon two of thy forefathers — Abraham and Isaac. Verily, thy Lord is All-Knowing, Wise.’"
"Surely, in Joseph and his brethren there are Signs for the inquirers."
"When they said, ‘Verily, Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we are, although we are a strong party. Surely, our father is in manifest error."
"‘Kill Joseph or cast him out to some (distant) land, so that your father’s favour may become exclusively yours and you can thereafter become a righteous people.’"
"One of them said, ‘Kill not Joseph, but if you must do something, cast him into the bottom of a deep well; some of the travellers will pick him up.’"
"They said, ‘O our father, why dost thou not trust us with respect to Joseph, when we are certainly his sincere well-wishers?"
"‘Send him with us tomorrow that he may enjoy himself and play, and we shall surely keep guard over him.’"
"He said, ‘It grieves me that you should take him away, and I fear lest the wolf should devour him while you are heedless of him.’"
"They said, ‘Surely, if the wolf devour him while we are a strong party, then we shall indeed be (great) losers.’"
"So, when they took him away, and agreed to put him into the bottom of a deep well, (they had their malicious design carried out); and We sent a revelation to him, (saying), ‘Thou shalt surely (one day) tell them of this affair of theirs and they shall not know.’"
"And they came to their father in the evening, weeping."
"They said, ‘O our father, we sent forth racing with one another, and left Joseph with our things, and the wolf devoured him, but thou wilt not believe us even if we speak the truth.’"
"And they came with false blood on his shirt. He said, ‘Nay, but your souls have made a (great) thing appear light in your eyes. So (now) comely patience (is good for me). And it is Allah (alone) Whose help is to be sought against what you assert.’"
"And there came a caravan of travellers and they sent their waterdrawer. And he let down his bucket (into the well). ‘Oh, good news!’ said he, ‘Here is a youth!’ And they concealed him as a piece of merchandise, and Allah knew full well what they did."
"And they sold him for a paltry price, a few dirhems, and they were not desirous of it."
"And the man from Egypt who bought him said to his wife, ‘Make his stay honourable. Maybe he will be of benefit to us; or we shall adopt him as a son.’ And thus did We establish Joseph in the land, and (We did so) that We might (also) teach him the interpretation of things. And Allah has full power over His decree, but most men know (it) not."
"And when he attained his (age of) full strength, We granted him judgment and knowledge. And thus do We reward the doers of good."
"And she, in whose house he was, sought to seduce him against his will. And she bolted the doors, and said, ‘Now come.’ He said, ‘I seek refuge with Allah. He is my Lord. He has made my stay (with you) honourable. Verily, the wrongdoers never prosper.’"
"And she made up her mind with regard to him, and he made up his mind with regard to her. If he had not seen a manifest Sign of his Lord, (he could not have shown such determination). Thus was it, that We might turn away from him evil and indecency. Surely, he was (one) of Our chosen servants."
"And they both raced to the door, and she tore his shirt from behind, and they found her lord at the door. She said, ‘What shall be the punishment of one who intended evil to thy wife, save imprisonment or a grievous chastisement?’"
"He said, ‘She it was who sought to seduce me against my will.’ And a witness of her household bore witness (saying), ‘If his shirt is torn from the front, then she has spoken the truth and he is of the liars."
"‘But if his shirt is torn from behind, then she has lied and he is of the truthful.’"
"So when he saw his shirt torn from behind, he said, ‘Surely, this is a device of you women. Your device is indeed mighty."
"‘O Joseph, turn away from this and thou, (O woman), ask forgiveness for thy sin. Certainly, thou art of the guilty.’"
"And women in the city said, ‘The wife of the ‘Aziz seeks to seduce her slave-boy against his will. He has infatuated her with love. Indeed, we see her in manifest error.’"
"And when she heard of their (crafty) design, she sent for them and prepared for them a repast, and gave every one of them a knife and (then) said (to Joseph), ‘Come forth to them.’ And when they saw him they thought much of him and cut their hands, and said, ‘Allah be glorified! This is not a human being; this is but a noble angel.’"
"She said, ‘And this is he about whom you blamed me. I did seek to seduce him against his will, but he preserved himself (from sin). And now if he do not what I bid him, he shall certainly be imprisoned and become (one) of the humbled.’"
"He said, ‘O my Lord, I would prefer prison to that to which they invite me; and unless Thou turn away their guile from me I shall incline towards them and be of the ignorant.’"
"So his Lord heard his prayer, and turned away their guile from him. Verily, He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing."
"Then it occurred to them (the men) after they had seen the signs (of his innocence) that, (to preserve their good name), they should imprison him for a time."
"And with him there entered the prison two young men. One of them said, ‘I saw myself (in a dream) pressing wine.’ And the other said, ‘I saw myself (in a dream) carrying upon my head bread of which the birds are eating. Inform us of the interpretation thereof; for we see thee to be of the righteous.’"
"He replied, ‘The food which you are given shall not come to you but I shall inform you of the interpretation thereof before it comes to you. This is on account of what my Lord has taught me. I have renounced the religion of the people who do not believe in Allah and who are disbelievers in the Hereafter."
"‘And I have followed the religion of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. We cannot indeed associate anything as partner with Allah. This is of Allah’s grace upon us and upon mankind, but most men are ungrateful."
"‘O my two companions of the prison, are diverse lords better or Allah, the One, the Most Supreme?"
"‘You worship nothing beside Allah, but (mere) names that you have named, you and your fathers; Allah has sent down no authority for that. The decision rests with Allah alone. He has commanded that you shall not worship anything save Him. That is the right religion, but most men know (it) not."
"‘O my two companions of the prison, as for one of you, he will pour out wine, for his lord to drink; and as for the other, he will be crucified so that the birds will eat  from off his head. The matter about which you inquired has been decreed.’"
"And of the two, he said to him whom he thought to be the one who would escape: ‘Mention me to thy lord.’ But Satan caused him to forget mentioning (it) to his lord, so he remained in prison for some years."
"And the King said, ‘I see (in a dream) seven fat kine which seven lean ones eat up, and seven green ears of corn and (seven) others withered. O ye chiefs, explain to me the meaning of my dream if you can interpret a dream.’"
"They replied, ‘They are confused dreams, and we do not know the interpretation of such confused dreams.’"
"And he of the two who had escaped, and who (now) remembered after a time, said, ‘I will let you know its interpretation, therefore send ye me.’"
"‘Joseph! O thou man of truth, explain to us the meaning of seven fat kine which seven lean ones devour, and of seven green ears of corn and (seven) others withered; that I may return to the people so that they may know.’"
"He replied, ‘You shall sow for seven years, working hard and continuously, and leave what you reap in its ear, except a little which you shall eat."
‘Then there shall come after that seven hard years which shall consume all that you shall have laid by in advance for them except a little which you may preserve.
‘Then there shall come after that a year in which people shall be relieved and in which they shall give presents (to each other).’
"And the King said, ‘Bring him to me.’ But when the messenger came to him, he said, ‘Go back to thy lord and ask him how fare the women who cut their hands: for, my Lord well knows their crafty design.’"
"He (the King) said (to the women), ‘What was the matter with you when you sought to seduce Joseph against his will?’ They said, ‘He kept away (from sin) for fear of Allah — we have known no evil against him.’ The wife of the ‘Aziz said, ‘Now has the truth come to light. It was I who sought to seduce him against his will, and surely, he is the truthful.’"
" (Joseph said), ‘(I asked for that enquiry to be made) so that he (the ‘Aziz) might know that I was not unfaithful to him in (his) absence and that Allah suffers not the device of the unfaithful to succeed."
"‘And I do not hold my own self to be free from weakness; for, the soul is surely prone to enjoin evil, save that whereon my Lord has mercy. Surely, my Lord is Most Forgiving, Merciful.’"
"And the King said, ‘Bring him to me that I may take him specially for myself.’ And when he had spoken to  him, he said, ‘Thou art this day (a man) of established position (and) trust with us.’"
"He said, ‘Appoint me over the treasures of the land, for I am a good keeper, (and) possessed of knowledge.’"
"And thus did We establish Joseph in the land. He dwelt therein wherever he pleased. We bestow Our mercy on whomsoever We please, and We suffer not the reward of the righteous to perish."
"And surely, the reward of the Hereafter is better for those who believe and fear God."
"And Joseph’s brethren came and entered in unto him; and he knew them, but they knew him not."
"And when he had provided them with their provision, he said, ‘Bring me your brother on your father’s side. Do you not see that I give you full measure (of corn) and that I am the best of hosts?"
"‘But if you bring him not to me, then there shall be no measure (of corn) for you from me, nor shall you come near me.’"
"They replied, ‘We will try to induce his father to part with him and we will certainly do (it).’"
"And he said to his servants, ‘Put their money (also) into their saddlebags that they may recognize it when they return to their family; haply they may come back.’"
"And when they returned to their father, they said, ‘O our father, (a) (further) measure (of corn) has been denied us, so send with us our brother that we may obtain our measure, and we will surely take care of him.’"
"He said, ‘I cannot trust you with him, save as I trusted you with his brother before. But Allah is the best Protector, and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.’"
"And when they opened their goods, they found their money returned to them. They said, ‘O our father, what more can we desire? Here is our money returned to us. We shall bring provision for our family, and guard our brother and we shall have in addition the measure of a camel-(load). That is a measure which is easy (to obtain).’"
"He said, ‘I will not send him with you until you give me a solemn promise in the name of Allah that you will surely bring him to me, unless you are encompassed.’ And when they gave him their solemn promise, he said, ‘Allah watches over what we say.’"
"And he said, ‘O my sons, enter not by one gate, but enter by different gates; and I can avail you nothing against Allah. The decision rests only with Allah. In Him do I put my trust and in Him let all who would trust put their trust.’"
"And when they entered in the manner their father had commanded them, it could not avail them anything against Allah, except that there was a desire in Jacob’s mind which he (thus) satisfied; and he was surely possessed of (great) knowledge because We had taught him, but most men know not."
"And when they visited Joseph, he lodged his brother with himself. (And) he said, ‘I am thy brother; so (now) grieve not at what they have been doing.’"
"And when he had provided them with their provision, he put the drinking-cup in his brother’s saddlebag. Then a crier cried, ‘O ye (men of the) caravan, you have been guilty of theft.’"
"They said, turning towards them, ‘What is it that you miss?’"
"They replied, ‘We miss the King’s measuring-cup, and whoso brings it shall have a camel-load, and I am surety for it.’"
"They answered, ‘By Allah, you know well that we came not to act corruptly in the land, and we are not thieves.’"
"They said, ‘What then shall be the punishment for it, if you (are found to) have told a lie?’"
"They replied, ‘The punishment for it — he in whose saddlebag it is found shall himself be the penalty for it. Thus do we punish the wrongdoers.’"
"Then he began (the search) with their sacks before the sack of his brother; then he took it out from his brother’s sack. Thus did We plan for Joseph. He could not have taken his brother under the King’s law unless Allah had (so) willed. We raise in degrees (of rank) whomsoever We please; and over every possessor of knowledge is One, Most-Knowing."
"They said, ‘If he has stolen, a brother of his had (also) committed theft before.’ But Joseph kept it secret in his heart and did not disclose it to them. He (simply) said, ‘You seem to be in the worst condition; and Allah knows best what you allege.’"
"They said, ‘O exalted one, he has a very aged father, so take one of us in his stead; for we see thee to be of those who do good.’"
"He replied, ‘Allah forbid that we should take (any) save him with whom we found our property; for then we should certainly be unjust.’"
"And when they despaired of him, they retired, conferring together in private. Their leader said, “Know ye not that your father has taken from you a solemn promise in the name of Allah and how, before this, you failed in your duty with respect to Joseph? I will, therefore, not leave the land until my father permits me or Allah decides for me. And He is the Best of judges."
"“Return ye to your father and say, ‘O our father, thy son has stolen and we have stated only what we know and we could not be guardians over the unseen."
"‘And inquire of (the people of) the city wherein we were, and of the caravan with which we came, and certainly we are speaking the truth.’”"
"He replied, ‘Nay, but your souls have embellished to you this thing. So (now) comely patience (is good for me). May be Allah will bring them all to me; for He is the All-Knowing, the Wise.’"
"And he turned away from them and said, ‘O my grief for Joseph!’  And his eyes became white because of grief, and he was suppressing (his sorrow)."
"They said, ‘By Allah, thou wilt not cease talking of Joseph until thou art wasted away or thou art of those who perish.’"
"He replied, ‘I only complain of my sorrow and my grief to Allah, and I know from Allah that which you know not."
"‘O my sons, go ye and search for Joseph and his brother and despair not of the mercy of Allah; for none despairs of Allah’s mercy save the unbelieving people.’"
"And, when they came before him (Joseph), they said, ‘O exalted one, poverty has smitten us and our family, and we have brought a paltry sum of money, so give us the full measure, and be charitable to us. Surely, Allah rewards the charitable.’"
"He said, ‘Do you know what you did to Joseph and his brother, when you were ignorant?’"
"They replied, ‘Art thou Joseph?’ He said, ‘(Yes), I am Joseph and this is my brother. Allah has indeed been gracious to us. Verily, whoso is righteous and is steadfast — Allah will never suffer the reward of the good to be lost.’"
"They replied, ‘By Allah! Surely has Allah preferred thee above us and we have indeed been sinners.’"
"He said, ‘No blame (shall lie) on you this day; may Allah forgive you! And He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy."
‘Go with this shirt of mine and lay it before my father: he will come to know. And bring to me the whole of your family.’
"And when the caravan departed, their father said, ‘Surely, I feel the scent of Joseph, even though you take me to be a dotard.’"
"They replied, ‘By Allah, thou art assuredly in thy old error.’"
"And when the bearer of glad tidings came, he laid it before him and he became enlightened. (Then) he said, ‘Did I not say to you: I know from Allah what you know not?’"
"They said, ‘O our father, ask forgiveness of our sins for us; we have indeed been sinners.’"
"He said, ‘I will certainly ask forgiveness for you of my Lord. Surely, He is the Most Forgiving, the Merciful.’"
"And when they came to Joseph, he put up his parents with himself, and said, ‘Enter Egypt in peace, if it please Allah.’"
"And he raised his parents upon the throne, and they (all) fell down prostrate (before God) for him. And he said, ‘O my father, this is the fulfilment of my dream of old. My Lord has made it true. And He bestowed a favour upon me when He took me out of the prison and brought you from the desert after Satan had stirred up discord between me and my brethren. Surely, my Lord is Benignant to whomsoever He pleases; for He is the All-Knowing, the Wise."
"‘O my Lord, Thou hast bestowed power upon me and taught me the interpretation of dreams. O Maker of the heavens and  the earth, Thou art my Protector in this world and the Hereafter. Let death come to me in a state of submission (to Thy will) and join me to the righteous.’"
"That is of the tidings of the unseen, (which) We reveal to thee. And thou wast not with them when they agreed upon their plan while they were plotting."
And most men will not believe even though thou eagerly desire (it).
"And thou dost not ask of them any reward for it. (On the contrary), it is but (a source of) honour for all mankind."
"And how many a Sign is there in the heavens and the earth, which they pass by, turning away from it."
And most of them believe not in Allah without (also) attributing partners (to Him).
"Do they, then, feel secure from the coming on them of an overwhelming punishment from Allah or the sudden coming of the Hour upon them while they are unaware?"
"Say, ‘This is my way: I call unto Allah on sure knowledge, I and those who follow me. And Holy is Allah; and I am not of those who associate gods (with God).’"
"And We sent not before thee (as Messengers) any but men, whom We inspired, from among the people of the towns. Have they not then travelled in the earth and seen what was the end of those before them?  And surely, the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who fear God. Will you not then understand?"
"Till, when the Messengers despaired (of the disbelievers) and they (the disbelievers) thought that they had been told a lie, Our help came to them, then was saved he whom We pleased. And Our chastisement cannot be averted from the sinful people."
"Assuredly, in their narrative is a lesson for men of understanding. It is not a thing that has been forged, but a fulfilment of that which is before it and a detailed exposition of all things, and a guidance and a mercy to a people who believe."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"Alif Lam Mim Ra. These are verses of the Book. And that which has been revealed to thee from thy Lord is the truth, but most men believe not."
"Allah is He Who raised up the heavens without any pillars that you can see. Then He settled Himself on the Throne. And He pressed the sun and the moon into service: each pursues its course until an appointed term. He regulates it all. He clearly explains the Signs, that you may have a firm belief in the meeting with your Lord."
"And He it is Who spread out the earth and made therein mountains and rivers. And fruits of every kind He made therein in two sexes. He causes the night to cover the day. Therein, verily, are Signs for a people who reflect."
"And in the earth are (diverse) tracts, adjoining one another, and gardens of vines, and corn-fields, and datepalms, growing together from one root and (others) not so growing; they are watered with the same water, yet We make some of them excel others in fruit. Therein are Signs for a people who understand."
"And if thou dost wonder, then wondrous indeed is their saying: ‘What! when we have become dust,  shall we then be in (a state of) new creation?’ These it is who disbelieve in their Lord; and these it is who shall have shackles round their necks, and they shall be the inmates of the Fire, wherein they shall abide."
"And they want thee to hasten on the punishment in preference to good, whereas exemplary punishments have (already) occurred before them. And verily, thy Lord is full of forgiveness for mankind despite their wrongdoing, and verily, thy Lord is (also) strict in condign punishment."
"And those who disbelieve say, ‘Wherefore has not a Sign been sent down to him from his Lord?’ Thou art, surely, a Warner. And there is a Guide for every people."
"Allah knows what every female bears, and what wombs diminish and what they cause to grow. And with Him everything has a (proper) measure."
" (He is the) Knower of the unseen and the seen, the Incomparably Great, the Most High."
"He among you who conceals (his) word, and he who utters it openly are equal (in His sight); and (also) he who hides by night, and he who goes forth (openly) by day."
"For him (the Messenger) is a succession (of angels) before him and behind him; they guard him by the command of Allah. Surely, Allah changes not the condition of a people until they change that which is in their hearts. And when Allah wishes to punish a people, there is no repelling it, nor have they any helper beside Him."
"He it is Who shows you the lightning (to inspire) fear and hope, and He raises the heavy clouds."
"And the thunder glorifies Him with His praise and (likewise do) the angels for awe of Him; and He sends the thunderbolts, and smites therewith whom He wills, yet they dispute concerning Allah, while He is severe in punishing."
"Unto Him is the true prayer. And those on whom they call beside Him answer them not at all, except as he (is answered) who stretches forth his two hands toward water that it may reach his mouth, but it reaches it not. And the prayer of the disbelievers is but a thing wasted."
"And to Allah submits whosoever is in the heavens and the earth willingly or unwillingly and (likewise do) their shadows, in the mornings and the evenings."
"Say, ‘Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?’ Say, ‘Allah.’ Say, ‘Have you then taken beside Him helpers who have no power for good or harm (even) for themselves?’ Say, ‘Can the blind and the seeing be equal? Or, can darkness be equal to light? Or, do they assign to Allah partners who have created the like of His creation so that the (two) creations appear similar to them?’ Say, ‘Allah (alone) is the Creator of all things, and He is the One, the Most Supreme.’"
"He sends down water from the sky, so that valleys flow according to their measure, and the flood bears (on its surface) swelling foam. And from that which they heat in the fire, seeking (to make) ornaments or utensils, (comes out) a foam similar to it. Thus does Allah illustrate truth and  falsehood. Now, as to the foam, it goes away as rubbish, but as to that which benefits men, it stays on the earth. Thus does Allah set forth parables."
"For those who respond to their Lord is (eternal) good; and (as for) those who respond not to Him, if they had all that is in the earth and the like of it added thereto, they would (readily) ransom themselves therewith. It is these that shall have an evil reckoning, and their abode is Hell. What a wretched place of rest!"
"Is he, then, who knows that what has been revealed to thee from thy Lord is the truth, like one who is blind? (But) only those gifted with understanding will reflect:"
"Those who fulfil Allah’s pact, and break not the covenant;"
"And those who join what Allah has commanded to be joined, and fear their Lord, and dread the evil reckoning;"
"And those who persevere in seeking the favour of their Lord, and observe Prayer, and spend out of that with which We have provided them, secretly and openly, and repel evil with good. It is these who shall have the (best) reward of the (final) Abode — "
"Gardens of Eternity. They shall enter them and (also) those who are righteous from among their fathers, and their wives and their children. And angels shall enter unto them from every gate, (saying):"
"‘Peace be unto you, because you were steadfast; behold how excellent is the reward of the (final) Abode!’"
"And those who break the covenant of Allah, after having established it and cut asunder what Allah has commanded to be joined, and act corruptly in the earth — on them is the curse and they shall have a grievous abode."
"Allah enlarges (His) provision for whomsoever He pleases and straitens (it for whomsoever He pleases). And they rejoice in the present life, while the present life is but a (temporary) enjoyment as compared with that which is to come."
"And those who disbelieve say, ‘Why is not a Sign sent down to him from his Lord?’ Say, ‘Allah lets go astray those whom He wills and guides to Himself those who turn (to Him):"
"‘Those who believe, and whose hearts find comfort in the remembrance of Allah. Aye! it is in the remembrance of Allah that hearts can find comfort;"
"‘Those who believe and do good works — happiness shall be theirs, and an excellent place of return.’"
"Thus have We sent thee to a people, before whom other peoples have passed away, that thou mayest recite to them what We have revealed to thee, yet they disbelieve in the Gracious (God). Say, ‘He is my Lord; there is no God but He. In Him do I put my trust and towards Him is my return.’"
"And if there were a Qur’an by which mountains could be moved or by which the earth could be cut asunder or by which the dead could be spoken to, (they would not believe in it). Nay, the matter rests entirely  with Allah. Have not the believers (yet) come to know that, if Allah had (enforced) His will, He could have surely guided all mankind? And as for those who disbelieve, disaster shall not cease to befall them for what they have wrought or to alight near their home, until the promise of Allah comes to pass. Surely, Allah fails not in (His) promise."
"And surely, Messengers have been mocked at before thee; but I granted respite to those who disbelieved. Then I seized them, and how was then My punishment!"
"Will then He, Who stands over every soul (to note) what it earns, (let them go unpunished)? Yet, they ascribe partners to Allah. Say, ‘Name them.’ Would you inform Him of what He does not know in the earth? Or, is it (a mere) empty saying? Nay, but the design of the disbelievers has been made (to appear) beautiful in their eyes, and they have been kept back from the (right) way. And he whom Allah lets go astray shall have no guide."
"For them is a punishment in the present life; and, surely, the punishment of the Hereafter is harder, and they will have no defender against Allah."
"The similitude of the Heaven promised to the God-fearing is, that through it flow streams: its fruit is everlasting, and (so is) its shade. That is the reward of those who are righteous; and the reward of the disbelievers is Fire."
"And those to whom We have given the Book rejoice in what has been revealed to thee. And of the (different) parties there are (some) who deny a part thereof. Say, ‘I am only commanded to worship Allah and  not to set up equals to Him. Unto Him do I call, and unto Him is my return.’"
"And thus have We revealed it as a clear judgment. And if thou follow their evil desires after the knowledge that has come to thee, thou shalt have no friend nor defender against Allah."
"And, indeed, We sent Messengers before thee, and We gave them wives and children. And it is not possible for a Messenger to bring a Sign save by the command of Allah. For every term there is a (divine) decree."
"Allah effaces what He wills and established (what He wills), and with Him is the source of (all) commandments."
"And whether We make thee see (the fulfilment of) some of the things with which We threaten them or (whether) We make thee die, (it makes little difference), for on thee lies only the delivery of the Message, and on Us the reckoning."
"Do they not see that We are visiting the land, reducing it from its outlying borders? And Allah judges; there is none to reverse His judgment. And He is swift at reckoning."
"And those who were before them did (also) devise plans, but all (effective) devising of plans belongs to Allah. He knows what every soul earns; and the disbelievers shall soon know whose will be the final reward of (this) abode."
"And those who disbelieve say, ‘Thou art not a Messenger.’ Say, ‘Sufficient is Allah as a Witness between me and you, and (so is) he who possesses knowledge of the Book.’"
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"Alif Lam Ra. (This is) a Book which We have revealed to thee that thou mayest bring mankind out of every (kind of) darkness into light, by the command of their Lord, to the path of the Mighty, the Praiseworthy — "
"Allah, to Whom belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth. And woe to the disbelievers for a terrible punishment:"
"Those who prefer the present life to the Hereafter, and hinder (men) from the way of Allah and seek to make it crooked. It is these who have gone far off in error."
"And We have not sent any Messenger except with the language of his people in order that he might make (things) clear to them. Then Allah lets go astray whom He wills, and guides whom He wills. And He is the Mighty, the Wise."
"And We did send Moses with Our Signs, (saying), ‘Bring forth thy people from every (kind of) darkness into light, and remind them of the days of Allah.’ Surely, therein are Signs for every patient (and) thankful person."
"And (call to mind) when Moses said to his people, ‘Remember Allah’s favour upon you when He delivered you from Pharaoh’s people who afflicted you with grievous torment, slaying your sons and sparing your women; and in that there was a great trial for you from your Lord.’"
"And (remember also the time) when your Lord declared, ‘If you are grateful, I will, surely, bestow more (favours) on you; but if you are ungrateful, (then know that) My punishment is severe indeed.’"
"And Moses said, ‘If you disbelieve, you and those who are in the earth all together, (you can do no harm to God); verily, Allah is Self- Sufficient, Praiseworthy.’"
"Have not the tidings come to you of those before you, the people of Noah, and (the tribes of) ‘Ad and Thamud, and those after them? None knows them (now) save Allah. Their Messengers came to them with clear Signs, but they turned their hands to their mouths, and said, ‘We disbelieve in that with which you have been sent and surely, we are in disquieting doubt concerning that to which you call us.’"
"Their Messengers said, ‘Are you in doubt concerning Allah, Maker of the heavens and the earth? He calls you that He may forgive you your sins, and grant you respite till an appointed term.’ They said, ‘You are but men like ourselves; you desire to turn us away from that which our fathers used to worship. Bring us, then, a clear proof.’"
"Their Messengers said to them, ‘We are indeed only men like yourselves, but Allah bestows (His) favour on whomsoever He wills from among His servants. And it is not for us to bring you a proof except by the command of Allah. And in Allah (alone) should the believers put their trust."
"‘And why should we not put our trust in Allah when He has showed us our ways? And we will, surely, bear with patience (all) the harm you do us. So in Allah let those who trust put their trust.’"
"And those who disbelieved said to their Messengers, ‘We will, surely, expel you from our land unless you return to our religion.’ Then their Lord sent unto them the revelation: ‘We will, surely, destroy the wrongdoers."
"‘And We will, surely, make you dwell in the land after them. This is for him who fears to stand before My Tribunal and fears My warning.’"
"And they prayed for victory, and (as a result thereof) every haughty enemy (of truth) came to naught."
Before him is Hell; and he shall be made to drink boiling water.
"He shall sip it and shall not be able to swallow it easily. And death shall come to him from every quarter, (yet) he shall not die. And besides that there shall be (for him) a severe chastisement."
"The case of those who disbelieve in their Lord is that their works are like ashes on which the wind blows violently on a stormy day. They shall have no power over what they earned. That, indeed, is extreme ruin."
"Dost thou not see that Allah created the heavens and the earth in accordance with the requirements of wisdom? If He please, He can do away with you, and bring a new creation."
And that is not (at all) hard for Allah.
"They shall all appear before Allah; then shall the weak say to those who behaved proudly: ‘Surely, we were your followers; can you not then avail us aught against Allah’s punishment?’ They will say, ‘If Allah had guided us, we would, surely, have guided you. (But) it is (now) equal for us whether we show impatience or remain patient: there is no way of escape for us.’"
"And when the matter is decided, Satan will say, ‘Allah promised you a promise of truth, but I promised you and failed you. And I had no power over you except that I called you and you obeyed me. So blame me not, but blame your own selves. I cannot succour you nor can you succour me. I have already disclaimed your associating me (with God). For the wrongdoers there shall, surely, be a grievous punishment.’"
"And those who believe and do good works will be admitted into Gardens through which rivers flow, wherein they will abide by the command of their Lord. Their greeting therein will be ‘Peace’."
"Dost thou not see how Allah sets forth the similitude of a good word? (It is) like a good tree, whose root is firm and whose branches (reach) into heaven."
It brings forth its fruit at all times by the command of its Lord. And Allah sets forth similitudes for men that they may reflect.
"And the case of an evil word is like (that of) an evil tree, which is uprooted from above the earth and has no stability."
"Allah strengthens the believers with the word that is firmly established, (both) in the present life and in the Hereafter; and Allah lets the wrongdoers go astray. And Allah does what He wills."
Dost thou not see those who changed Allah’s favour into ingratitude and landed their people into the abode of ruin — 
 (Which is) Hell? They shall burn therein; and an evil place of rest is that.
"And they have set up rivals to Allah to mislead (people) from His way. Say, ‘Enjoy yourselves a while, then, surely, your journey is toward the Fire.’"
"Say to My servants who have believed, that they should observe Prayer and spend out of what We have given them, secretly and openly, before there comes a day wherein there will be neither bargaining nor friendship."
"Allah is He Who created the heavens and the earth and caused water to come down from the clouds, and brought forth therewith fruits for your sustenance; and He has subjected to you the ships that they may sail through the sea by His command, and the rivers (too) has He subjected to you."
"And He has (also) subjected to you the sun and the moon, both performing their work constantly. And He has subjected to you the night as well as the day."
"And He gave you all that you wanted of Him; and if you (try to) count the favours of Allah, you will not be able to number them. Verily, man is very unjust, very ungrateful."
"And (remember) when Abraham said, ‘My Lord, make this city (a city) of peace, and keep me and my children away from worshipping idols."
"‘My Lord, they have indeed led astray many among mankind. So whoever follows me, he is certainly of me; and whoever disobeys me —  Thou art, surely, Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"‘Our Lord, I have settled some of my children in an uncultivable valley near Thy Sacred House — our Lord — that they may observe Prayer. So make men’s hearts incline towards them and provide them with fruits, that they may be thankful."
"‘Our Lord, certainly, Thou knowest what we conceal and what we make known. And nothing whatsoever is hidden from Allah, whether in the earth or in the heaven."
"‘All praise belongs to Allah, Who has given me, despite (my) old age, Ishmael and Isaac. Surely, my Lord is the Hearer of prayer."
"‘My Lord, make me observe Prayer, and my children (too). Our Lord! (bestow Thy grace on me) and accept my prayer."
"‘Our Lord, grant forgiveness to me and to my parents and to the believers on the day when the reckoning will take place.’"
"And think not that Allah is unaware of what the wrongdoers do. He only gives them respite till the day on which the eyes will fixedly stare,"
"Hurrying on in fright, raising up their heads, their gaze not returning to them, and their minds (utterly) void."
"And warn men of the day when (the promised) chastisement will come upon them, and the wrongdoers will say, ‘Our Lord, grant us respite for a short term. We will respond to Thy call and will follow the Messengers.’ ‘Did you not swear before this (that) you would have no fall?"
"‘And you dwell in the dwellings of those who wronged themselves, and it has become plain to you how We dealt with them; and We have set forth (clear) parables for you.’"
"And they have already made their designs; but their designs are with Allah. And even though their designs be such as to make the mountains move, (they cannot succeed)."
"Think not then that Allah will fail to keep His promise to His Messengers. Surely, Allah is Mighty, Lord of retribution,"
"On the day when this earth will be changed into another earth, and the heavens (too); and they will (all) appear before Allah, the One, the Most Supreme;"
And thou shalt see the guilty on that day bound in chains.
"Their garments shall be of pitch, and the fire shall envelop their faces."
" (It will be so) that Allah may requite each soul for what it has wrought. Surely, Allah is swift at reckoning."
"This is a sufficient admonition for mankind (that they may benefit by it), and that they may be warned thereby, and that they may know that He is the only One God, and that those possessed of understanding may ponder."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
Alif Lam Ra. These are verses of the Book and of the illuminating Qur’an.
Often will the disbelievers wish that they were Muslims.
Leave them alone that they may eat and enjoy themselves and that vain hope may beguile them; but they will soon know.
And We have never destroyed any town but there was for it a known decree.
"No people can outstrip their appointed time, nor can they remain behind."
"And they said, ‘O thou to whom this Exhortation has been sent down, thou art surely a madman."
"‘Why dost thou not bring angels to us, if thou art of the truthful?’"
"We do not send down angels but by due right, and then they are granted no respite."
"Verily, We Ourself have sent down this Exhortation, and most surely We will be its Guardian."
And We sent (Messengers) before thee among parties of ancient peoples.
And there never came to them any Messenger but they mocked at him.
Thus do We cause this (habit of mocking) to enter into the hearts of the sinful people;
"They believe not therein, though the example of the former peoples has gone (before them)."
"And even if We opened to them a door from heaven, and they began ascending through it,"
"They would surely say, ‘Only our eyes are dazed; rather we are a bewitched people.’"
"And We have, indeed, made mansions (of stars) in the heaven and have adorned it for beholders."
And We have protected it against every rejected satan.
"But if any one hears stealthily, there pursues him a bright flame."
"And the earth have We spread out, and set therein firm mountains and caused everything to grow therein in proper proportion."
"And We have made for you therein means of livelihood, and (also) for (all) those for whom you do not provide."
And there is not a thing but with Us are the treasures thereof and We send it not down except in a known measure.
"And We send impregnating winds, then We send down water from the clouds, then We give it to you to drink; and you are not the ones to store it up."
"And verily, it is We Who give life, and We Who cause death; and it is We Who are the (sole) Inheritor."
And We do know those who go ahead among you and We do know those who lag behind.
"And surely, it is thy Lord Who will gather them together. Surely, He is Wise, All-Knowing."
"And, surely, We created man from dry ringing clay, from black mud wrought into shape."
And the Jinn We had created before from the fire of hot wind.
"And (remember) when thy Lord said to the angels, ‘I am about to create man from dry ringing clay, from black mud wrought into shape;"
"‘So when I have fashioned him (in perfection) and have breathed into him of My Spirit, fall ye down in submission to him.’"
"So the angels submitted, all of them together,"
Except Iblis; he refused to be among those who submit.
" (God) said, ‘O Iblis, what is the matter with thee that thou wouldst not be among those who submit?’"
"He answered, ‘I am not going to submit to man whom Thou hast created from dry ringing clay, from black mud wrought into shape.’"
" (God) said, ‘Then get out hence, for, surely, thou art rejected."
"‘And, surely, on thee shall be (My) curse till the Day of Judgment.’"
"He said, ‘My Lord, then grant me respite till the day when they shall be raised.’"
" (God) said, ‘Thou art of those that are granted respite,"
‘Till the day of the appointed time.’
"He answered, ‘My Lord, since Thou hast adjudged me as lost, I will surely make (evil appear) beautiful to them on the earth, and I will surely lead them all astray,"
‘Except Thy chosen servants from among them.’
" (God) said, ‘This is a path (leading) straight to Me."
"‘Surely, thou shalt have no power over My servants, except such of the erring ones as (choose to) follow thee.’"
"And, surely, Hell is the promised place for them all."
It has seven gates: (and) each gate has a portion of them allotted (to it).
"Verily, the righteous will be (placed) amid gardens and fountains."
"‘Enter therein with peace, in safety.’"
"And We shall remove whatever of rancour may be in their breasts (so that they will become) as brothers (seated) on thrones, facing one another."
"Fatigue shall not touch them there, nor shall they (ever) be ejected therefrom."
"Tell My servants that I am surely the One Most Forgiving, the Merciful;"
And (also) that My punishment is the grievous punishment.
And tell them about Abraham’s guests.
"When they entered in unto him and said, ‘Peace,’ he answered, ‘Verily, we feel afraid of you.’"
"They said, ‘Fear not, we give thee glad tidings of a son (who shall be) endowed with knowledge.’"
"He said, ‘Do you give me the glad tidings in spite of the fact that old age has overtaken me? Of what then do you give me the glad tidings?’"
"They said, ‘We have, indeed, given thee glad tidings in truth; be not therefore of those who despair.’"
"He said, ‘And who can despair of the mercy of his Lord save those who go astray?’"
"He said, ‘What (now) is your business, O ye messengers?’"
"They said, ‘We have been sent unto a guilty people"
"‘Excepting the family of Lot. Them we shall save all,"
‘Except his wife. We surmise that she shall be of those who remain behind.’
"And when the messengers came unto the family of Lot,"
"He said, ‘Verily, you are a party of strangers.’"
"They said, ‘Nay, but we have come to thee with that about which they doubted."
"‘And we have come to thee with the truth, and surely we are truthful."
"‘So go forth with thy family in the (latter) part of the night, and follow thou in their rear. And let none of you look back, and (now) proceed to where you are commanded.’"
And We communicated to him this decree that the root of them was to be cut off by the morning.
And the people of the city came rejoicing.
"He said, ‘These are my guests, so put me not to shame;"
‘And fear Allah and disgrace me not.’
"They said, ‘Did we not forbid thee (to entertain) all (sorts of) people?’"
"He said, ‘These are my daughters if you must do something.’"
"By thy life, these (too) in their (mad) intoxication are wandering in distraction — "
Then the punishment seized them at sunrise.
"We turned it upside down, and We rained upon them stones of clay."
"Surely, in this are Signs for those who can read (signs)."
And it lies on a road that (still) exists.
"Surely, in this is a Sign for believers."
And the People of the Wood (too) were surely wrongdoers.
So We chastised them (also). And they both lie on a manifest way.
And the People of the Hijr (also) did treat the Messengers as liars.
"And We gave them Our Signs, but they turned away from them."
"And they used to hew out houses in the mountains, in security."
"But the punishment seized them in the morning,"
And all that they had earned availed them not.
And We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between the two but in accordance with the requirements of wisdom; and the Hour is sure to come. So turn away (from them) in a comely manner.
"Verily, it is thy Lord Who is the Great Creator, the All-Knowing."
"And We have, indeed, given thee the seven oft-repeated (verses), and the Great Qur’an."
"Stretch not thy eyes towards what We have bestowed on some classes of them to enjoy for a short time, and grieve not over them; and lower thy wing (of mercy) for the believers."
"And say, ‘I am, indeed, a plain Warner.’"
Because We (have decided to) send down (punishment) on those who have formed themselves into groups (against thee);
Who have pronounced the Qur’an to be (so many) lies;
"So by thy Lord, We will, surely, question them all"
Concerning that which they used to do.
So declare openly that with which thou art commanded and turn aside from those who ascribe partners (to God.)
"We will, surely, suffice thee against those who mock:"
"Who set up another God with Allah, but soon shall they come to know."
"And, indeed, We know that thy bosom becomes straitened because of what they say."
"But glorify thy Lord praising Him, and be of those who prostrate themselves (before Him)."
"And continue worshipping thy Lord, till death comes to thee."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"The decree of Allah is coming, so seek ye not to hasten it. Holy is He, and exalted above all that which they associate (with Him)."
"He sends down the angels with revelation by His command on whomsoever of His servants He pleases (saying), ‘Warn (people) that there is no God but I, so take Me (alone) for your Protector.’"
He has created the heavens and the earth in accordance with the requirements of wisdom. Exalted is He above all that they associate (with Him).
"He has created man from a drop of fluid, but lo! he is an open disputer."
And the cattle too He has created; you find in them warmth and (other) uses; and some of them you eat.
"And in them there is beauty for you when you bring (them) home in the evening, and when you drive (them) forth to pasture in the morning."
"And they carry your loads to a land which you could not reach except with great hardship to yourselves. Surely, your Lord is Compassionate, Merciful."
"And (He has created) horses and mules and asses that you may ride them, and as (a source of) beauty. And He will create what you do not (yet) know."
"And upon Allah rests the (showing of the) right way, and there are ways which deviate (from the right course). And if He had (enforced) His will, He would have guided you all."
"He it is Who sends down water for you from the clouds; out of it you have your drink, and there (grow) from it trees on which you pasture (your cattle.)"
"Therewith He grows corn for you, and the olive and the datepalm, and the grapes, and all kinds of fruits. Surely, in that is a Sign for a people who reflect."
"And He has pressed into service for you the night and the day, and the sun and the moon; and the stars (too) have been pressed into service by His command. Surely, in that are Signs for a people who make use of their reason."
"And (He has pressed into service) the things He has created for you in the earth, varying in colours. Surely, in that is a Sign for a people who take heed."
"And He it is Who has subjected (to you) the sea that you may eat therefrom fresh flesh, and may take forth therefrom ornaments which you wear. And thou seest the ships ploughing through it, (that you may thereby journey) and that you may seek of His bounty and that you may be grateful."
"And He has placed in the earth firm mountains lest it quake with you, and rivers and routes that you may take the right way."
"And, (other) marks (too); (by them) and by the stars they follow the right direction."
"Is He, then, Who creates like one who creates not? Will you not then take heed?"
"And if you (try) to count the favours of Allah, you will not be able to number them. Surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
And Allah knows what you conceal and what you disclose.
"And those on whom they call beside Allah create not anything, but they are themselves created."
" (They are) dead, not living; and they know not when they will be raised."
"Your God is One God. And as to those who believe not in the Hereafter, their hearts are strangers (to truth), and they are full of pride."
"Undoubtedly, Allah knows what they conceal and what they disclose. Surely, He loves not the proud."
"And when it is said to them, ‘What (think ye of) that which your Lord has sent down?’, they say, ‘Stories of the ancients,’"
"That they may bear their burdens in full on the Day of Resurrection, and (also) a portion of the burdens of  those whom they lead astray without knowledge. Behold! evil is that which they bear."
"Those who were before them did (also) plan, but Allah came upon their structure at the (very) foundations, so that the roof fell down upon them from above them; and the punishment came upon them from where they knew not."
"Then on the Day of Resurrection He will disgrace them and will say, “Where are My ‘partners’ for whose sake you used to oppose (the Prophets)?” Those endowed with knowledge will say, ‘This day disgrace and affliction will surely (fall) on the disbelievers,’"
"Those whom the angels cause to die while they are wronging their souls. Then will they offer submission, (saying), ‘We used not to do any evil.’ Nay, surely, Allah knows well what you used to do."
"So enter the gates of Hell, to abide therein. Evil indeed is the abode of the proud."
"And (when) it is said to the righteous, ‘What (think ye of) that which your Lord has revealed?’ they say, ‘The best.’ For those who do good there is good in this world. And the home of the Hereafter is even better. Excellent indeed is the abode of the righteous — "
"Gardens of Eternity, which they will enter; through them flow streams. They will have therein what they wish for. Thus does Allah reward the righteous,"
Those whom the angels cause to die while they are pure. They say: ‘Peace be unto you! Enter Heaven because of what you used to do.’
"What do they wait for except that the angels should come upon them or that the decree of thy Lord should come to pass? So did those who were before them. Allah did not wrong them, but they used to wrong themselves."
"So the evil (result) of what they did befell them, and that which they used to mock at encompassed them."
"Those who set up equals (to God) say: ‘If Allah had (so) willed, we should not have worshipped anything beside Him, neither we nor our fathers, nor should we have forbidden anything without (command from) Him.’ So did those who were before them. But are the Messengers responsible for anything except the plain delivery of the Message?"
"And We did raise among every people a Messenger, (preaching): ‘Worship Allah and shun the Evil One.’ Then among them were (some) whom Allah guided and among them were (some) who became deserving of ruin. So travel through the earth, and see what was the end of those who treated (the Prophets) as liars!"
"If thou art solicitous of their guidance, then (know that) Allah surely guides not those who lead (others) astray. And for such there are no helpers."
"And they swear by Allah their strongest oaths, that Allah will not raise up those who die. Nay, (He will certainly raise them up) — a promise (He has made) binding on Himself, but most people know not."
" (He will raise them up) that He may make clear to them that wherein they differed, and that those  who disbelieved may know that they were liars."
"Our word to a thing, when We will it, is only that We say to it, ‘Be!’, and it is."
"And (as to) those who have left their homes for the sake of Allah after they had been wronged, We will surely give them a goodly abode in this world: and truly the reward of the Hereafter is greater, if they but knew — "
Those who are steadfast and put their trust in their Lord.
"And We sent not (as Messengers) before thee but men to whom We sent revelation, so ask those who possess the Reminder, if you know not."
" (We sent Our Messengers) with clear Signs and Scriptures. And We have sent down to thee the Reminder that thou mayest explain to mankind that which has been sent down to them, and that they may reflect."
"Do, then, those who devise evil plans feel secure that Allah will not make them sink into the land, or that the punishment will not come upon them from whence they do not know?"
Or that He will not seize them in their going to and fro so that they shall not be able to frustrate (God’s plans)?
"Or that He will not seize them by (a process of) gradual destruction? Your Lord is indeed Compassionate, Merciful."
"Have they not seen that the shadows of everything which Allah has created shift from the right and (from) the left, prostrating themselves to Allah, while they are being humbled?"
"And whatever is in the heavens and whatever creature is in the earth submits (humbly) to Allah, and the angels (too), and they do not behave proudly."
"They fear their Lord above them, and do what they are commanded."
"Allah has said, ‘Take not (for worship) two gods. There is only One God. So fear Me alone.’"
And to Him belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and to Him is due obedience for ever. Will you then fear any other than Allah?
"And whatever blessing you have, it is from Allah. And when affliction befalls you, it is unto Him that you cry (for help)."
"Then, when He removes the affliction from you, behold! a party among you (begins to) attribute equals to their Lord,"
"So that they deny that which We have bestowed upon them. Well, enjoy yourselves a little; but soon will you know."
"And they set apart (for the false deities) of which they know nothing a portion of that which We have bestowed on them. By Allah, you shall certainly be called to account for all that you have forged."
And they ascribe daughters to Allah — Holy is He! — while they (themselves) have what they desire.
"And when to one of them is conveyed the tidings of (the birth of) a female, his face darkens, while he suppresses (his inward) grief."
"He hides himself from the people because of the bad news he has had: ‘Shall he keep it in spite of disgrace or bury it in the dust?’ Verily, evil is that which they judge."
"The state of those who do not believe in the Hereafter is evil, while Allah’s attribute is sublime and He is the Mighty, the Wise."
"And if Allah were to punish men for their wrongdoing, He would not leave thereon a living creature, but He gives them respite till an appointed term; and when their term is come, they cannot remain behind a single hour, nor can they go ahead (of it)."
"And they attribute to Allah what they dislike (for themselves) and their tongues utter the lie that they will have the best (of everything). Undoubtedly, theirs shall be the Fire, and (therein) shall they be abandoned."
"By Allah, We did send (Messengers) to the peoples before thee; but Satan made their works (appear) beautiful to them. So he is their patron this day, and they shall have a grievous punishment."
"And We have not sent down to thee the Book except that thou mayest explain to them that concerning which they differ, and as a guidance, and a mercy for a people who believe."
"And Allah has sent down water from the sky, and has quickened therewith the earth after its death.  Surely, in that is a Sign for a people who would hear."
"And surely in the cattle (too) there is a lesson for you. We give you to drink of what is in their bellies, from betwixt the faeces and the blood, milk pure (and) pleasant for those who drink (it)."
"And of the fruits of the datepalms and the grapes, whence you obtain intoxicating drink and wholesome food. Verily, in that is a Sign for a people who make use of their reason."
"And thy Lord has inspired the bee, (saying), ‘Make thou houses in the hills and in the trees and in the trellises which they build."
"‘Then eat of every (kind of) fruit, and follow the ways of thy Lord (that have been) made easy (for thee).’ There comes forth from their bellies a drink of varying hues. Therein is cure for men. Surely, in that is a Sign for a people who reflect."
"And Allah creates you, then He causes you to die; and there are (some) among you who are driven to the worst part of life, with the result that they know nothing after (having had) knowledge. Surely, Allah is All-Knowing, Powerful."
"And Allah has favoured some of you above others in (worldly) gifts. But those more favoured will not restore (any part of) their (worldly) gifts to those whom their right hands possess, so that they may be equal (sharers) in them. Will they then deny the favour of Allah?"
"And Allah has made for you mates from among yourselves, and has made for you, from your mates, sons and grandsons, and has provided you with good things. Will they then believe in vain things and deny the favour of Allah?"
"And they worship beside Allah such as have no power to bestow on them any gift from the heavens or the earth, nor can they (ever) have such power."
"So coin not similitudes for Allah. Surely, Allah knows and you know not."
"Allah sets forth the parable of a slave who is owned, having no power over anything; and (a free man) whom We have provided with a fair provision from Ourself, and he spends thereof secretly and openly. Are they equal? Praise be to Allah! But most of them know not."
"And Allah sets forth (another) parable of two men: one of them is dumb, having no power over anything, and he is a burden to his master; whithersoever he sends him, he brings no good. Can he be equal to him who enjoins justice and who is himself on the straight path?"
"And to Allah belongs the unseen of the heavens and the earth; and the matter of the Hour is but as the twinkling of an eye, nay, it is nearer still. Surely, Allah has power over all things."
"And Allah brought you forth from the wombs of your mothers while you knew nothing, and gave you ears and eyes and hearts, that you might be grateful."
"Do they not see the birds held under subjection in the vault of heaven? None keeps them back save Allah. Verily, in that are Signs for a people who believe."
"And Allah has made your homes, a place of rest for you and has made for you, of the skins of cattle, abodes which you find light at the time when you travel and at the time when you halt; and of their wool, and their furs, and their hair, (He has supplied you with) household goods and articles of use for a time."
"And Allah has made for you, of that which He has created, (things affording) shade; and He has made for you, in the mountains, places of shelter; and He has made for you garments which protect you from heat, and coats of mail which protect you in your wars. Thus does He complete His favour on you, that you may submit (to Him)."
"But if they turn away, then thou art responsible only for the plain delivery of the Message."
"They recognize the favour of Allah, yet they deny it; and most of them are (confirmed) disbelievers."
"And (remember) the day when We shall raise up a witness from every people, then those who disbelieve shall not be permitted (to make amends), nor shall they be allowed to solicit (God’s) favour."
"And when those who did wrong (actually) see the punishment, it will not be made light for them, nor will they be granted respite."
"And when those who associate partners (with God) will see their associate-gods, they will say, ‘Our Lord, these are our associate-gods whom we used to call upon instead of Thee.’ Thereupon, they will retort on them with the words, ‘Surely, you are liars.’"
"And they will offer submission to Allah on that day, and all that they used to forge shall fail them."
" (As for) those who disbelieve and turn (men) away from the way of Allah, We will add punishment to (their) punishment because they acted corruptly."
"And (remember) the day when We will raise up in every people a witness against them from amongst themselves, and We will bring thee as a witness against these. And We have sent down to thee the Book to explain everything, and a guidance, and a mercy, and glad tidings to those who submit (to God.)"
"Verily, Allah enjoins justice, and the doing of good to others; and giving like kindred; and forbids indecency, and manifest evil, and wrongful transgression. He admonished you that you may take heed."
"And fulfil the covenant of Allah when you have made; and break not the oaths after making them firm, while you have made Allah your surety. Certainly, Allah knows what you do."
"And be not like unto her who, after having made it strong, breaks her yarn into pieces. You make your oaths a means of deceit between  you, (for fear) lest one people become more powerful than another. Surely, Allah tries you therewith, and on the Day of Resurrection He will make clear to you that wherein you differed."
"And if Allah had (enforced) His will, He would surely have made you (all) one people; but He lets go astray him who wishes (it), and guides him who wishes (it); and you shall surely be questioned concerning that which you have been doing."
"And make not your oaths a means of deceit between you; or (your) foot will slip after it has been firmly established, and you will taste evil because you turned (people) away from the path of Allah, and you will have a severe punishment."
"And barter not the covenant of Allah for a paltry price. Surely, that which is with Allah is better for you if you only knew."
"That which you have shall pass away, but that which is with Allah is lasting. And We will certainly give those who are steadfast their reward according to the best of their works."
"Whoso acts righteously, whether male or female, and is a believer, We will surely grant him a pure life; and We will surely bestow on such their reward according to the best of their works."
"And when thou recitest the Qur’an, seek refuge with Allah from Satan the rejected."
"Surely, he has no power over those who believe and who put their trust in their Lord."
His power is only over those who make friends with him and who set up equals to Him.
"And when We bring one Sign in place of another — and Allah knows best what He reveals — they say, ‘Thou art but a fabricator.’ Nay, but most of them know not."
"Say, ‘The Spirit of holiness has brought it down from thy Lord with truth, that He may strengthen those who believe, and as a guidance and glad tidings for Muslims.’"
"And indeed We know that they say that it is only a man who teaches him. (But) the tongue of him to whom they (unjustly) incline (in making this insinuation) is foreign, while this is Arabic tongue, plain and clear."
" (As for) those who do not believe in the Signs of Allah, surely, Allah will not guide them, and they shall have a grievous punishment."
"It is only those who believe not in the Signs of Allah, that forge falsehood, and they it is who are the liars."
"Whoso disbelieves in Allah after he has believed — save him who is forced (thereto) while his heart finds peace in the faith — but such as open their breasts to disbelief, on them is Allah’s wrath; and they shall have a severe punishment."
"That is because they have preferred the present life to the Hereafter, and because Allah guides not the disbelieving people."
It is they on whose hearts and ears and eyes Allah has set a seal. And it is they who are the heedless.
"Undoubtedly, it is they who will be the losers in the Hereafter."
"Then, surely, thy Lord — to those who fled (their homes) after they had been persecuted and then struggled hard (in the cause of Allah) and remained steadfast — (aye), surely, after that thy Lord is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"On the day when every soul will come pleading for itself, and every soul will be fully recompensed for what it did, and they will not be wronged."
"And Allah sets forth (for you) the parable of a city which enjoyed security and peace; its provisions came to it in plenty from every quarter; but it denied the favours of Allah, so Allah made it taste hunger and fear (which clothed it like) a garment because of what they used to do."
"And indeed there has come to them a Messenger from among themselves, but they treated him as a liar, so punishment overtook them while they were wrongdoers."
"So eat of the lawful (and) good things which Allah has provided for you; and be grateful for the bounty of Allah, if it is Him you worship."
"He has made unlawful for you only that which dies of itself and blood and the flesh of swine and that on which the name of any other than Allah has been invoked. But he who is driven by necessity, being neither disobedient nor exceeding the limit, then surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"And say not — because of the falsehood which your tongues utter — ‘This is lawful, and this is unlawful,’ so as to forge a lie against Allah. Surely, those who forge a lie against Allah do not prosper."
" (It is) a brief enjoyment, and (then) they shall have a grievous punishment."
"And to those (also) who are Jews, We forbade before (this) all that We have related to thee. And We wronged them not, but they used to wrong themselves."
"Then surely, thy Lord — to those who do evil in ignorance and repent thereafter and make amends — (aye), surely, after that thy Lord is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"Abraham was indeed a paragon of virtue, obedient to Allah, ever inclined (to Him), and he was not of those who set up equals (to God);"
Grateful for His favours; He chose him and guided him to a straight path.
"And We bestowed on him good in this world, and in the Hereafter he will surely be among the righteous."
"And (now) We have revealed to thee, (saying), ‘Follow the way of Abraham (who was) ever inclined (to God) and was not of those who set up equals (to Him).’"
"The (punishment for profaning) the Sabbath was imposed only on those who had differed about it, and thy Lord will surely judge between them on the day of Resurrection about that in which they differed."
"Call unto the way of thy Lord with wisdom and goodly exhortation, and argue with them in a way that is best. Surely, thy Lord knows best who has strayed from His way; and He knows those who are rightly guided."
"And if you (desire to) punish (the oppressors), then punish (them) to the extent to which you have been wronged; but if you show patience, then, surely, that is best for those who are patient."
"And endure thou with patience; and verily, thy patience is (possible) only with (the help of) Allah. And grieve not for them, nor feel distressed because of their plots."
"Verily, Allah is with those who are righteous and those who do good."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"Glory be to Him Who carried His servant by night from the Sacred Mosque to the Distant Mosque, the environs of which We have blessed, that We might show him (some) of Our Signs. Surely, He alone is the Hearing, the Seeing."
"And We gave Moses the Book, and We made it a guidance for the children of Israel, (saying), ‘Take no guardian beside Me,"
‘O ye the progeny of those whom We carried (in the Ark) with Noah.’ He was indeed a grateful servant.
"And We revealed to the children of Israel in the Book, (saying), ‘You will surely do mischief in the land twice, and you will surely become excessively overbearing.’"
"So when the time for the first of the two warnings came, We sent against you (some) servants of Ours possessed of great might in war, and they penetrated the (innermost parts of your) houses, and it was a warning that was bound to be carried out."
"Then We gave you back the power against them, and aided you with wealth and children, and made you larger in numbers."
" (Now), if you do well, you will do well for your own souls; and if you do evil, it will (only go) against them.  So when the time for the latter warning came, (We raised a people against you) to cover your faces with grief, and to enter the Mosque as they entered it the first time, and to destroy all that they conquered with utter destruction."
"It may be that your Lord will (now) have mercy on you; but if you return (to your previous state,) We (too) will return, and We have made Hell a prison for the disbelievers."
"Surely, this Qur’an guides to what is most right; and gives to the believers who do good deeds the glad tidings that they shall have a great reward."
And that for those who do not believe in what is to come later We have prepared a grievous punishment.
And man asks for evil as he should ask for good; and man is hasty.
"And We have made the night and the day two Signs, and the Sign of night We have made dark, and the Sign of day We have made sightgiving, that you may seek bounty from your Lord, and that you may know the computation of years and (the science of) reckoning. And everything We have explained with a detailed explanation."
"And every man’s works have We fastened to his neck, and on the Day of Resurrection We shall bring out  for him a book which he will find wide open."
‘Read thy book. Sufficient is thy own soul this day as reckoner against thee.’
"He who follows the right way follows it only for (the good of) his (own) soul: and he who goes astray, goes astray only to his (own) loss. And no bearer of burden shall bear the burden of another. We never punish until We have sent a Messenger."
"And when We intend to destroy a township, We address Our commandment to its rebellious people, but they transgress therein; so the sentence (of punishment) becomes due against it, and We destroy it with utter destruction."
How many generations have We destroyed after Noah! And thy Lord suffices as the Knower and Seer of the sins of His servants.
"Whoso desires the present life, We hasten for him therein what We will — for such (of them) as We please; then have We appointed Hell for him; he shall burn therein, condemned (and) rejected."
"And whoso desires the Hereafter and strives for it as it should be striven for, and he is a believer —  these are the ones whose striving shall find favour (with God)."
To all We render aid — both to these and those — a gift from thy Lord. And the gift of thy Lord is not restricted.
"Behold, how We have exalted some of them over others (in the present life); and surely, the Hereafter shall be greater in degrees (of rank) and greater in excellence."
Set not up with Allah another God lest thou sit down disgraced (and) forsaken.
"Thy Lord has commanded, “Worship none but Him, and (show) kindness to parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age with thee, never say unto them any word expressive of disgust nor reproach them, but address them with excellent speech."
"“And lower to them the wing of humility out of tenderness. And say, ‘My Lord, have mercy on them even as they nourished me in (my) childhood.’”"
"Your Lord knows best what is in your minds; if you are righteous, then surely, He is Most Forgiving to those who turn (to Him) again and again."
"And give thou to the kinsman his due, and to the poor and the wayfarer, and squander not (thy wealth) extravagantly."
"Verily, the extravagant are brothers of satans, and Satan is ungrateful to his Lord."
"And if thou hast to turn away from them while seeking thy Lord’s mercy for which thou hopest, (even then) speak to them a gentle word."
"And keep not thy hand chained to thy neck, nor stretch it out an entire stretching, lest thou sit down blamed (or) exhausted."
"Surely, thy Lord enlarges (His) provision for whom He pleases, and straitens (it for whom He pleases). Verily, He knows (and) sees His servants full well."
"Kill not your children for fear of poverty. It is We Who provide for them and for you. Surely, the killing of them is a great sin."
"And come not near unto adultery; surely, it is a foul thing and an evil way."
"And kill not the soul which Allah has forbidden save for just cause. And whoso is killed wrongfully, We have surely given his heir authority (to demand retaliation), but let him not exceed the (prescribed) bounds in slaying; for (therein) he is helped (by law)."
"And come not near the property of the orphan, except in the best way, until he attains his maturity, and fulfil the covenant; for the covenant shall be questioned about."
"And give full measure when you measure, and weigh with a right balance; that is best and most commendable in the end."
"And follow not that of which thou hast no knowledge. Verily, the ear and the eye and the heart — all these shall be called to account."
"And walk not in the earth haughtily, for thou canst not rend the earth, nor canst thou reach the mountains in height."
The evil of all these is hateful in the sight of thy Lord.
"This is part of that wisdom which thy Lord has revealed to thee. And set not up with Allah any other God, lest thou be cast into Hell, condemned (and) rejected."
"Has, then, your Lord honoured you with sons, and taken for Himself females from among the angels? Surely, you say a grievous saying."
"We have explained (the truth) in this Qur’an in the various ways that they may be admonished, but it only increases them in aversion."
"Say, had there been other gods with Him, as they say, then they (idolaters) would have surely sought out a way to the Owner of the Throne."
"Holy is He, and exalted far above that which they say."
"The seven heavens and the earth and those that are therein extol His glory; and there is not a thing but glorifies Him with His praise; but you understand not their glorification. Verily, He is Forbearing, Most Forgiving."
"And when thou recitest the Qur’an, We put between thee and those who believe not in the Hereafter a hidden veil;"
"And We put coverings over their hearts lest they should understand it, and in their ears a deafness. And when thou makest mention in the Qur’an of thy Lord alone, they turn their backs in aversion."
"We know best what they listen for, when they listen to thee, and when they confer in private, when the wrongdoers say, ‘You follow none but a man who is a victim of deception.’"
"See, how they coin similitudes for thee, and have thus gone astray so that they cannot find a way."
"And they say, ‘When we shall have become bones and broken particles, shall we be really raised up as a new creation?’"
"Say, ‘Be ye stones or iron,"
"‘Or created matter of (any kind) which appears hardest in your minds, (even then shall you be raised up).’ Then will they ask, ‘Who shall restore us to life?’ Say, ‘He Who created you the first time.’ They will then shake their heads at thee and say, ‘When will it be?’ Say, ‘Maybe it is nigh,"
‘(It will be) on the day when He will call you; then will you respond praising Him and you will think that you have tarried but a little while.’
"And say to My servants that they should speak that which is best. Surely, Satan stirs up discord among them. Surely, Satan is an open enemy to man."
"Your Lord knows you best. If He please, He will have mercy on you; or if He please, He will punish you. And We have not sent thee to be a keeper over them."
"And thy Lord knows best those that are in the heavens and the earth. And We exalted some of the Prophets over the others, and to David We gave a Book."
"Say, ‘Call on those whom you think (to be gods) beside Him; then (you will know that) they have no power to remove affliction from you or to avert (it)."
"Those whom they call on (themselves) seek nearness to their Lord — (even) those of them who are nearest — and hope for His mercy, and fear His punishment. Surely, the punishment of thy Lord is a thing to be feared."
"There is not a township but We shall destroy it before the Day of Resurrection, or punish it with a severe punishment. That is written down in the Book."
"And nothing could hinder Us from sending Signs, except that the former people rejected them, (but this is no hindrance). And We gave Thamud the she-camel as a clear Sign, but they unjustly rejected it. And We send not Signs but to warn."
"And (remember the time) when We said to thee: ‘Surely, thy Lord has encompassed the people.’ And We made not the vision which We showed thee but as a trial for men, as also the tree cursed in the Qur’an. And We warn them, but it only increases them in great transgression."
"And (remember the time) when We said to the angels, ‘Submit to Adam,’ and they (all) submitted, except Iblis. He said, ‘Shall I submit to one whom Thou hast created of clay?’"
" (And) he said, ‘What thinkest Thou? (Can) this whom Thou hast honoured above me (be my superior)? If Thou wilt grant me respite till the Day of Resurrection, I will most surely bring his descendants under my sway except a few.’"
"He said, ‘Begone! and whoso shall follow thee from among them, Hell shall surely be the recompense of you all —  an ample recompense."
"‘And entice whomsoever of them thou canst, with thy voice, and urge against them thy horsemen and thy footmen and be their partner in wealth, and children, and make promises to them.’ And Satan promises them naught but deceit."
" (As to) My servants, thou shalt certainly have no power over them, and sufficient is thy Lord as a Guardian."
"Your Lord is He Who drives for you the ships in the sea, that you may seek of His bounty. Surely, He is merciful toward you."
"And when harm touches you on the sea, (all) those whom you call upon, except Him, become lost (to you). But when He brings you safe to land, you turn aside; and man is very ungrateful."
Do you then feel secure that He will (not) cause you to sink in the side of the land or send against you a violent sandstorm (and) then you will find no guardian for yourselves?
"Or, do you feel secure that He will (not) send you back therein a second time, (and) then send against you as a storm-blast, and drown you because of your disbelief? You will then find therein no helper for yourselves against Us."
"Indeed, We have honoured the children of Adam, and carried them by land and sea, and given them of good things and exalted them far above many of those whom We have created."
" (Remember) the day when We shall summon every people with their Leader. Then whoso shall be given his book in his right hand —  such will read their book, and they will not be wronged a whit."
"But whoso is blind in this world will be blind in the Hereafter, and even more astray from the way."
"And they had well-nigh caused thee (severest) affliction on account of what We have revealed to thee,  that thou mightest invent against Us something other than that; and then they would have certainly taken thee for a (special) friend."
"And if We had not strengthened thee (with the Qur)’(an), thou mightest have inclined to them a little."
"In that case We would have made thee taste similar (afflictions) of life and similar (afflictions) of death, (and) then thou wouldst not have found for thyself any helper against Us."
And indeed they are near to unsettling thee from the land that they might expel thee therefrom; but in that case they (themselves) would not have stayed after thee save a little.
 (This has been Our) way with Our Messengers whom We sent before thee; and thou wilt not find any change in Our way.
"Observe Prayer at the declining and paling of the sun on to the darkness of the night, and the recitation (of the Qur)’(an in Prayer) at dawn. Verily, the recitation (of the Qur)’(an) at dawn is (specially) acceptable (to God.)"
And wake up for it (the Qur’an) in (the latter part of) the night as a supererogatory service for thee. It may be that thy Lord will raise thee to an exalted station.
"And say, ‘O my Lord, make my entry a good entry and (then) make me come forth with a good forthcoming. And grant me from Thyself a helping power.’"
"And say, ‘Truth has come and falsehood has vanished away. Falsehood does indeed vanish away (fast).’"
And We are (gradually) revealing of the Qur’an that which is a healing and a mercy to the believers; but it only adds to the loss of the wrongdoers.
"And when We bestow favour on man, he turns away and goes aside; and when evil touches him, he gives (himself) up to despair."
"Say, ‘Everyone acts according to his own way, and your Lord knows full well who is best guided.’"
"And they ask thee concerning the soul. Say, ‘The soul is by the command of my Lord; and of the knowledge (thereof) you have been given but a little.’"
"And if We pleased, We could certainly take away that which We have revealed to thee (and) then thou wouldst find in (the matter) no guardian for thee against Us,"
"Except mercy from thy Lord. Surely, His grace towards thee is great."
"Say, ‘If mankind and the Jinn gathered together to produce the like of this Qur’an, they could not produce the like thereof, even though they should help one another.’"
"And surely, We have set forth for mankind in various ways all kinds of similitudes in this Qur’an, but most men would reject everything but disbelief."
"And they say, ‘We will never believe thee until thou cause a spring to gush forth for us from the earth;"
"‘Or thou have a garden of datepalms and vines, and cause streams to gush forth in the midst thereof in abundance;"
"‘Or thou cause the heaven to fall upon us in pieces, as thou hast claimed, or thou bring Allah and the angels before us face to face;"
"‘Or thou have a house of gold or thou ascend up into heaven; and we will not believe in thy ascension until thou send down to us a book that we can read.’ Say, ‘Holy is my Lord! I am not but a man (sent as a) Messenger.’"
"And nothing has prevented men from believing when the guidance came to them save that they said, ‘Has Allah sent a man (as a) Messenger?’"
"Say, ‘Had there been in the earth angels walking about in peace and quiet, We should have certainly sent down to them from heaven an angel (as a) Messenger.’"
"Say, ‘Sufficient is Allah for a Witness between me and you; surely, He knows and sees His servants full well.’"
"And he whom Allah guides, is the (only) one rightly guided; but (as for) those whom He allows to perish, thou wilt find for them no helpers beside Him. And on the Day of Resurrection We shall gather them togther on their faces, blind, dumb and deaf. Their abode will be Hell; every time it abates, We shall increase for them the flame."
"That is their recompense, because they rejected Our Signs and said, ‘What! when we are reduced to bones and broken particles, shall we really be raised up as a new creation?’"
Have they not seen that Allah Who created the heavens and the earth has the power to create the like  of them? And He has appointed for them a term; there is no doubt about it. But the wrongdoers would reject everything but disbelief.
"Say, ‘Even if you possessed the treasures of the mercy of my Lord, you would surely hold them back for fear of spending, for man is niggardly.’"
"And of a truth We gave Moses nine manifest Signs. So ask (then) the children of Israel. When he came to them, Pharaoh said to him, ‘I do think thee, O Moses, to be a victim of deception.’"
"He said, ‘Thou knowest well (that) none has sent down these (Signs) but the Lord of the heavens and the earth as (so many) evidences; and I certainly think thee, O Pharaoh, to be (a) ruined (man).’"
"So he resolved to remove them from the land; but We drowned him and those who were with him, all together."
"And after him We said to the children of Israel, ‘Dwell ye in the land; and when (the time of) the promise of the latter days comes, We shall bring you together (out of various peoples.)’"
And in truth have We sent it down and with truth has it descended. And We have sent thee only as a bearer of good tidings and a Warner.
"And the Qur’an We have revealed in pieces that thou mayest read it to mankind at intervals, and We have sent it down piecemeal."
"Say, “Whether you believe therein or believe not, those to whom knowledge has been given before it, do fall down prostrate on their faces when it is recited to them,"
"“And say, ‘Holy is our Lord. Surely, the promise of our Lord is bound to be fulfilled.’”"
"They fall down on their faces weeping, and it increases humility in them."
"Say, ‘Call upon Allah or call upon Rahman; (by) whichever name you call (Him), His are the most beautiful names.’ And utter not thy prayer aloud, nor utter it (too) low, but seek a way between."
"And say, ‘All praise belongs to Allah Who has taken unto Himself no son, and Who has no partner in (His) Kingdom, nor has He anyone to help (Him) on account of weakness.’ And extol His glory with all glorification."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
All praise belongs to Allah Who has sent down the Book to His servant and has not put therein any crookedness.
" (He has made it) a guardian, that it may give warning of a grievous chastisement from Him, and that it may give the believers who do good deeds the glad tidings that they shall have a good reward,"
Wherein they shall abide for ever;
"And that it may warn those who say, ‘ Allah has taken unto Himself a son.’"
"No knowledge have they thereof, nor (had) their fathers. Grievous is the word that comes from their mouths. They speak naught but a lie."
So haply thou wilt grieve thyself to death for sorrow after them if they believe not in this discourse.
"Verily, We have made all that is on the earth as an ornament for it, that We may try them as to which of them is best in conduct."
And We shall make all that is thereon a barren soil.
Dost thou think that the People of the Cave and the Inscription were a wonder among Our Signs?
"When the young men betook themselves for refuge to the Cave and said, ‘Our Lord, bestow on us mercy from Thyself, and provide for us right guidance in our affair.’"
So We sealed up their ears in the Cave for a number of years.
Then We raised them up that We might know which of the two parties would better reckon the time that they had tarried.
"We will relate to thee their story with truth: They were young men who believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance."
"And We strengthened their hearts, when they stood up and said, ‘Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. Never shall we call upon any god beside Him; (if we did), we should indeed have uttered an enormity."
"‘These, our people, have taken (for worship other) gods beside Him. Wherefore do they not bring a clear authority for them? And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie concerning Allah?"
"‘And (now) when you have withdrawn from them and from that which they worship beside Allah, then seek refuge in the Cave; your Lord will unfold for you His mercy and will provide for you comfort in (this) affair of yours.’"
"And thou couldst see the sun, as it rose, move away from their Cave on the right, and when it set, turn away from them on the left; and they were in the spacious hollow thereof.  This is among the Signs of Allah. He whom Allah guides is rightly guided; but he whom He adjudges astray, for him thou wilt find no helper (or) guide."
"Thou mightest deem them awake, whilst they are asleep; and We shall cause them to turn over to the right and to the left, their dog stretching out his forelegs on the threshold. If thou hadst had a look at them, thou wouldst surely have turned away from them in fright, and wouldst surely have been filled with awe of them."
"And so We raised them up that they might question one another. One of them said, ‘How long have you tarried?’ They said, ‘We have tarried a day or part of a day.’ (Others) said, ‘Your Lord knows best (the time) you have tarried. Now send one of you with these silver coins of yours to the city; and let him see which of its (inhabitants) has the purest food, and let him bring you provisions thereof. And let him be courteous and let him not inform anyone about you.’"
"‘For, if they should come to know of you, they would stone you or make you return to their religion and then will you never prosper.’"
"And thus did We disclose them (to the people) that they might know that the promise of Allah was true, and that, as to the Hour, there was no doubt about it. (And remember the time) when people disputed among  themselves concerning them, and said, ‘Build over them a building.’ Their Lord knew them best. Those who won their point said, ‘We will, surely, build a place of worship over them.’"
" (Some) say, ‘They were three, the fourth was their dog,’ and (others) say, ‘They were five, the sixth was their dog,’ guessing at random. And (yet others) say, ‘They were seven, the eighth was their dog.’ Say, ‘My Lord knows best their number. None knows them except a few.’ So argue not concerning them except with arguing (that is) overpowering, nor seek information about them from any one of them."
"And say not of anything, ‘I am going to do it tomorrow,’"
"Unless Allah should will. And remember thy Lord when thou forgettest, and say, ‘I hope my Lord will guide me to what is even nearer than this to the right path.’"
"And they stayed in their Cave three hundred years, and added nine more."
"Say, ‘Allah knows best how long they tarried.’ To Him belong the secrets of the heavens and the earth. How Seeing is He! and how Hearing! They have no helper beside Him, and He does not let anyone share in His government."
"And recite what has been revealed to thee of the Book of thy Lord. There is none who can change His words, and thou wilt find no refuge beside Him."
"And keep thyself attached to those who call on their Lord, morning and evening, seeking His pleasure; and let not thy eyes pass beyond them, seeking the adornment of the life of the world; and obey not him whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance and who follows his evil inclinations, and his case exceeds all bounds."
"And say, ‘(It is) the truth from your Lord; wherefore let him who will, believe, and let him who will, disbelieve.’ Verily, We have prepared for the wrongdoers a fire whose (flaming) canopy shall enclose them. And if they cry for help, they will be helped with water like molten lead which will burn the faces. How dreadful the drink, and how evil is (the Fire as) a resting place!"
"Verily, those who believe and do good works — surely, We suffer not the reward of those who do good works to be lost."
"It is these who will have Gardens of Eternity beneath which streams shall flow. They will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and will wear green garments of fine silk and heavy brocade, reclining therein upon raised couches. How good the reward and how excellent the place of rest!"
"And set forth to them the parable of two men: one of them We provided with two gardens of grapes, and surrounded them with datepalms, and between the two We placed corn-fields."
"Each of the gardens yielded its fruit (in abundance), and failed not the least therein. And in between the two We caused a stream to flow."
"And he had fruit (in abundance.) And he said to his companion, arguing (boastfully) with him, ‘I am richer than thou in wealth and stronger in respect of men.’"
"And he entered his garden while he was wronging his soul. He said, ‘I do not think this will ever perish;"
"‘And I do not think the Hour will (ever) come. And even if I am ever brought back to my Lord, I shall, surely, find a better resort than this.’"
"His companion said to him, while he was arguing with him, “Dost thou disbelieve in Him Who created thee from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then fashioned thee into a (perfect) man?"
"“But (as for me), I (believe that) Allah alone is my Lord, and I will not associate anyone with my Lord."
“And why didst thou not say when thou didst enter thy garden: ‘(Only) that which Allah wills (comes to pass.) There is no power save in Allah?’ if thou seest me as less than thee in riches and offspring.
"“Perhaps my Lord will give me something better than thy garden, and will send on it (thy garden) a thunderbolt from heaven so that it will become a bare slippery ground."
“Or its water will become sunk (in the earth) so that thou wilt not be able to find it.”
"And his fruit was (actually) destroyed, and he began to wring his hands for what he had spent on it, and it had (all) fallen down on its trellises. And he said, ‘Would that I had not associated anyone with my Lord!’"
"And he had no party to help him against Allah, nor was he able to defend himself."
"In such a case protection (comes only) from Allah, the True. He is the Best in respect of reward, and the Best in respect of consequence."
"And set forth to them the similitude of the life of this world: it is like the water which We send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth is mingled with it, and then it becomes dry grass broken into pieces which the winds scatter. And Allah has power over every thing."
"Wealth and children are an ornament of the life of this world. But enduring good works are better in the sight of thy Lord in respect of (immediate) reward, and better in respect of (future) hope."
"And (bethink of) the day when We shall remove the mountains, and thou wilt see the (nations of the) earth march forth (against one another) and We shall gather them together and shall not leave any one of them behind."
"And they will be presented to thy Lord, (standing) in rows: ‘Now have you come to Us as We created you at first. But you thought that We would fix no time for the fulfilment of (Our) promise to you.’"
"And the Book will be placed (before them), and thou wilt see the guilty fearful of that which is therein; and they will say, ‘O woe to us! What kind of a Book is this! It leaves out nothing small or great but has recorded it.’ And they will find all that they did confronting (them), and thy Lord does not wrong anyone."
"And (remember the time) when We said to the angels, ‘Submit to Adam,’ and they (all) submitted, except Iblis. He was (one) of the Jinn; and he disobeyed the command of his Lord. Will you then take him and his offspring for friends instead of Me while they are your enemies? Evil is the exchange for the wrongdoers."
"I did not make them witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor their own creation; nor could I take as helpers those who lead (people) astray."
"And (remember) the day when He will say, ‘Call those whom you deemed to be My partners.’ Then they will call on them, but they will not answer them; and We shall place a barrier between them."
And the guilty shall see the Fire and realize that they are going to fall therein; and they shall find no way of escape therefrom.
"And, surely, We have explained in various ways in this Qur’an, for (the good of) mankind, all (kinds of) similitudes, but of all things man is most contentious."
"And nothing hinders people from believing when the guidance comes to them, and from asking forgiveness of their Lord, except (that they wait) that there should happen to them the precedent of the ancients or that punishment should come upon them face to face."
And We send not the Messengers but as bearers of glad tidings and as Warners. And those who disbelieve contend by means of falsehood so that they may rebut the truth thereby. And they take My Signs and what they are warned of (only) as a jest.
"And who is more unjust than he who is reminded of the Signs of his Lord, but turns away from them, and forgets what his hands have sent forward? Verily, We have placed veils over their hearts that they understand it not, and in their ears a deafness. And if thou call them to guidance, they will never accept it."
"And thy Lord is Most Forgiving, full of mercy. If He were to seize them for what they have earned, then surely He would have hastened the punishment for them. But they have an appointed time from which they will find no refuge."
And these towns — We destroyed them when they committed iniquities. And We appointed a fixed time for their destruction.
"And (remember the time) when Moses said to his young (companion), ‘I will not stop until I reach the junction of the two seas, or I will journey on for ages.’"
"But when they reached the place where the two (seas) met, they forgot their fish, and it made its way into the sea (going away) swiftly."
"And when they had gone further, he said to his young (companion): ‘Bring us our morning meal. Surely, we have suffered much fatigue on account of this journey of ours.’"
"He replied, ‘Didst thou see, when we betook ourselves to the rock for rest, and I forgot the fish —  and none but Satan caused me to forget to mention it (to thee) — it took its way into the sea in a marvellous manner?’"
"He said, ‘That is what we have been seeking.’ So they both returned, retracing their footsteps."
"Then found they one of Our servants upon whom We had bestowed Our mercy, and whom We had taught knowledge from Ourself."
"Moses said to him, ‘May I follow thee on condition that thou teach me of the guidance which thou hast been taught?’"
"He replied, ‘Thou canst not keep company with me in patience."
‘And how canst thou be patient about things the knowledge of which thou comprehendest not?’
"He said, ‘Thou wilt find me, if Allah please, patient and I shall not disobey any command of thine.’"
"He said, ‘Well, if thou wouldst follow me, then ask me no questions about anything till I myself speak to thee concerning it.’"
"So they both set out till, when they embarked in a boat, he staved it in. (Moses) said, ‘Hast thou staved it in to drown those who are in it? Surely, thou hast done an evil thing.’"
"He replied, ‘Did I not tell (thee) that thou wouldst not be able to keep company with me in patience?’"
" (Moses) Said, ‘Take me not to task at my forgetting and be not hard on me for this (lapse) of mine.’"
"So they journeyed on till, when they met a young boy, he slew him. (Moses) said, ‘Hast thou slain an innocent person without (his having slain) any one? Surely, thou hast done a hideous thing!’"
"He replied, ‘Did I not tell thee that thou wouldst not be able to keep company with me in patience?’"
" (Moses) said, ‘If I ask thee concerning anything after this, keep me not in thy company, for (then) thou shalt have got sufficient excuse from me.’"
"So they went on till, when they came to the people of a town, they asked its people for food, but they refused to make them (their) guests. And they found therein a wall which was about to fall, and he repaired it. (Moses) said, ‘If thou hadst desired, thou couldst have taken payment for it.’"
"He said, ‘This is the parting (of ways) between me and thee. I will now tell thee the meaning of that which thou wast not able to bear with patience:"
"‘As for the boat, it belonged to (certain) poor people who worked on the sea; and I desired to damage it, for there was behind them a king, who seized every boat by force."
"‘And as for the youth, his parents were believers, and we feared lest he should cause them trouble through rebellion and disbelief."
‘So we desired that their Lord should give them in exchange (a child) better than him in purity and closer in (filial) affection.
"‘And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the town, and beneath it was a treasure belonging to them, and their father had been (a) righteous (man), so thy Lord desired that they should reach their (age of) full strength and take out their treasure, as a mercy from thy Lord; and I did it not of my own accord. This is the explanation of that which thou wast not able to bear with patience.’"
"And they ask thee about Dhu’l Qarnain. Say, ‘I will certainly recite to you (something) of his story.’"
We established him in the earth and gave him the means to (accomplish) everything.
Then he followed a (certain) way
"Until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it setting in a pool of murky water, and near it he found a people. We said, ‘O Dhu’l Qarnain, either punish them, or treat them with kindness.’"
"He said, ‘As for him who does wrong, we shall certainly punish him; then shall he be brought back to his Lord, Who will punish him with a dreadful punishment.’"
"But as for him who believes and acts righteously, he will have a good reward, and We shall speak to him easy (words) of Our command."
Then (indeed) he followed (another) way
"Until, when he reached the rising of the sun, he found it rising on a people for whom We had made no shelter against it."
"Thus (indeed it was). Verily, We encompassed with Our knowledge (all) that was with him."
Then he followed (another) way
"Until, when he reached the place between the two mountains, he found beneath them a people who would scarcely understand a word."
"They said, ‘O Dhu’l Qarnain, verily, Gog and Magog are creating disorder in the earth; shall we then pay thee tribute on condition that thou set up a barrier between us and them?’"
"He replied, ‘The power with which my Lord has endowed me about this is better, but you may help me with physical strength; I will set up between you and them a rampart."
"‘Bring me blocks of iron.’ (They did so) till, when he had levelled up the space between the two mountain sides, he said, ‘(Now) blow (with your bellows).’ (They blew) till, when he had made it (red as) fire, he said, ‘Bring me molten copper that I may pour it thereon.’"
"So they (Gog and Magog) were not able to scale it, nor were they able to dig through it."
" (Thereupon) he said, ‘This is a mercy from my Lord. But when the promise of my Lord shall come to pass, He will break it into pieces. And the promise of my Lord is (certainly) true.’"
"And on that day We shall leave some of them to surge against others, and the trumpet will be blown. Then shall We gather them all together."
"And on that day We shall present Hell, face to face, to the disbelievers — "
"Whose eyes were under a veil (so as not) to (heed) My warning, and they could not even hear."
"Do the disbelievers think that they can take My servants as protectors instead of Me? Surely, We have prepared Hell as an entertainment for the disbelievers."
"Say, ‘Shall We tell you of those who are the greatest losers in respect of their works? — "
"‘Those whose labour is (all) lost in (search after things pertaining to) the life of this world, and they think that they are doing good works.’"
"Those are they who disbelieve in the Signs of their Lord and in the meeting with Him. So their works are vain, and on the Day of Resurrection We shall give them no weight."
"That is their reward — Hell; because they disbelieved, and made a jest of My Signs and My Messengers."
"Surely, those who believe and do good deeds, will have Gardens of Paradise for an abode,"
Wherein they will abide; they will not desire any change therefrom.
"Say, ‘If the ocean became ink for the words of my Lord, surely, the ocean would be exhausted before the words of my Lord came to an end, even though We brought the like thereof as (further) help.’"
"Say, ‘I am only a man like yourselves; (but) I have received the revelation that your God is only One God. So let him who hopes to meet his Lord do good deeds, and let him join no one in the worship of his Lord.’"
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
Kaf Ha Ya ‘Ain Sad.
" (This is) an account of the mercy of thy Lord (shown) to His servant, Zachariah."
"When he called upon his Lord, a secret calling,"
"He said, ‘My Lord, the bones have indeed waxed feeble in me, and the head glistens with hoariness, but never, my Lord, have I been unblessed in my prayer to Thee."
"‘And I fear my relations after me, and my wife is barren. Grant me, therefore, a successor from Thyself,"
"‘That he may be heir to me and to the House of Jacob. And make him, my Lord, well-pleasing to Thee.’"
"‘O Zachariah, We give thee glad tidings of a son whose name (shall) be Yahya‡. We have not made any one before him of that name.’"
"He said, ‘My Lord, how shall I have a son when my wife is barren and I have reached (the) extreme (limit of) old age?’"
"He said, ‘So it is.’ But thy Lord says, ‘It is easy for Me, and indeed I created thee before, when thou wast nothing.’"
"He said, ‘My Lord, appoint for me a token.’(God) said, ‘Thy token is that thou shalt not speak to anyone for three full (days and) nights.’"
Then he came forth unto his people from the chamber and asked them by signs to glorify (God) in the morning and in the evening.
"‘O Yahya, hold fast the Book.’ And We gave him wisdom while yet a child,"
"And tenderness (of heart) from Ourself, and purity. And he was pious"
And dutiful toward his parents. And he was not haughty (and) rebellious.
"And peace was on him the day he was born, and the day he died, and (peace there will be on him) the day he will be raised up to life (again.)"
"And relate (the story of) Mary (as mentioned) in the Book. When she withdrew from her people to a place to the east,"
"And screened herself off from them, then We sent Our angel to her, and he appeared to her in the form of a perfect man."
"She said, ‘I seek refuge with the Gracious (God) from thee if indeed thou dost fear (Him).’"
"He replied, ‘I am only a Messenger of thy Lord, that I may bestow on thee a righteous son.’"
"She said, ‘How can I have a son when no man has touched me, neither have I been unchaste?’"
"He replied, ‘Thus it is.’ But says thy Lord, ‘It is easy for Me; and (We shall do so) that We may make him a Sign unto men, and a mercy from Us, and it is a thing decreed.’"
"So she conceived him, and withdrew with him to a remote place."
"And the pains of childbirth drove her unto the trunk of a palm-tree. She said, ‘O! would that I had died before this and had become a thing quite forgotten!’"
"Then he called her from beneath her, (saying), “Grieve not. Thy Lord has placed a rivulet below thee;"
“And shake towards thyself the trunk of the palm-tree; it will cause fresh ripe dates to fall upon thee.
"“So eat and drink, and cool (thy) eye. And if thou seest any man, say, ‘I have vowed a fast to the Gracious (God); I will therefore not speak this day to any human being.’”"
"Then she brought him to her people, carrying him. They said, ‘O Mary, thou hast brought forth a strange thing."
"‘O sister of Aaron, thy father was not a wicked man nor was thy mother an unchaste woman!’"
"Then she pointed to him. They said, ‘How can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle?’"
"He said, ‘I am a servant of Allah. He has given me the Book, and made me a Prophet;"
"‘And He has made me blessed wheresoever I may be, and has enjoined upon me Prayer and almsgiving so long as I live;"
"‘And (He has made me) dutiful toward my mother, and He has not made me haughty (and) unblessed."
"‘And peace was on me the day I was born, and (peace there will be on me) the day I shall die, and the day I shall be raised up to life (again).’"
"Such was Jesus, son of Mary. (This is) a statement of the truth about which they doubt."
"It does not befit (the Majesty of) Allah to take unto Himself a son. Holy is He. When He decrees a thing, He says to it, ‘Be!’, and it is."
" (Said Jesus): ‘Surely, Allah is my Lord, and your Lord. So worship Him (alone); this is the right path.’"
But the parties differed among themselves; so woe to those who disbelieve because of the meeting of the great day.
How wonderful will their hearing and seeing be on the day when they will come to Us! But today the wrongdoers are in manifest error.
"And warn them of the day of grief when the matter will be decided. But now they are in (a state of) carelessness, so they do not believe."
It is We Who will inherit the earth and (all) who are thereon; and to Us will they (all) be returned.
And relate (the story of) Abraham (as mentioned) in the Book. He was (a) truthful (man and) a Prophet.
"When he said to his father, ‘O my father, why dost thou worship that which hears not, nor sees, nor can avail thee aught?"
"‘O my father, there has indeed come to me knowledge such as has not come to thee; so follow me, I will guide thee to an even path."
"‘O my father, serve not Satan; surely, Satan is a rebel against the Gracious (God.)"
"‘O my father, indeed, I fear lest a punishment from the Gracious (God) seize thee, and thou become a comrade of Satan.’"
"He replied, ‘Dost thou turn away from my gods, O Abraham? If thou cease not, I shall surely cut off all relations with thee. Now leave me alone for a long while.’"
" (Abraham) said, ‘Peace be on thee.’ I will ask forgiveness of my Lord for thee. He is indeed gracious to me."
"‘And I shall keep away from you and from that which you call upon beside Allah; and I will pray unto my Lord; it may be that, in praying to my Lord, I shall not be disappointed.’"
"So when he had separated himself from them and from that which they worshipped beside Allah, We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob, and each (of them) We made a Prophet."
And We granted them of Our mercy; and We bestowed on them a true renown.
"And relate (the story of) Moses (as mentioned) in the Book. He was indeed a chosen one; and he was a Messenger, a Prophet."
"And We called him from the right side of the Mount, and made him draw near (to Us) for (special) communion."
"And We bestowed upon him, out of Our mercy, his brother Aaron as a Prophet."
"And relate (the story of) Ishmael (as mentioned) in the Book. He was indeed strict in (keeping his) promise. And he was a Messenger, a Prophet."
"He used to enjoin Prayer and almsgiving on his people, and he was well pleasing to his Lord."
And relate (the story of) Idris (as mentioned) in the Book. He was (a) truthful (man and) a Prophet.
And We exalted him to a lofty station.
"These are the people on whom Allah bestowed His blessings from among the Prophets, of the posterity of Adam, and of (the posterity of) those whom We carried (in the Ark) with Noah, and of the posterity of Abraham and Israel; and (they are) of those whom We guided and chose. When the Signs of the Gracious (God) were recited unto them, they fell down, prostrating themselves (before God) and weeping."
"Then there came after them descendants who neglected Prayer, and followed evil desires. So they will meet with destruction,"
"Except those who repent and believe and do good deeds. These will enter Heaven, and they will not be wronged in the least — "
"Gardens of Eternity, which the Gracious (God) has promised to His servants in the unseen. Surely, His promise must come to pass."
"They will not hear therein anything vain, but only (greetings of) Peace: and they will have their sustenance therein, morning and evening."
Such is the Heaven which We give for an inheritance to those of Our servants who are righteous.
‘And we (angels) do not come down save by the command of thy Lord. To Him belongs all that is  before us and all that is behind us and all that is between; and thy Lord is not forgetful.’
" (He is) the Lord of the heavens and the earth and of all that is between the two. Serve Him, therefore, and be steadfast in His service. Dost thou know any equal of His?"
"And says man, ‘What! when I am dead, shall I be brought forth alive?’"
"Does not man remember that We created him before, when he was naught?"
"And, by thy Lord, We shall assuredly gather them together, and the satans (too); then shall We bring them on their knees around Hell."
"Then shall We certainly pick out, from every group, those of them who were most stubborn in rebellion against the Gracious (God.)"
"And surely, We know best those most deserving to be burned therein."
And there is not one of you but will come to it. This is a fixed decree with thy Lord.
"Then We shall save the righteous and We shall leave the wrongdoers therein, on their knees."
"And when Our manifest Signs are recited unto them, the disbelievers say to the believers, ‘Which of the two parties is better in (respect of) position and (makes) a more impressive assembly?’"
"And how many generations have We destroyed before them, who were better off in wealth and better in outward show!"
"Say, ‘The Gracious (God) does give those who are in error long respite until, when they will see that with which they are threatened —  whether it be punishment or the Hour — they will realize who is worse in respect of position and who is weaker in forces."
"‘And Allah increases in guidance those who follow guidance. And the good works that endure are best in sight of thy Lord as reward, and best as resort.’"
"Hast thou then seen him who disbelieves in Our Signs, and says, ‘I shall certainly be given wealth and children?’"
Has he become acquainted with the unseen or has he taken a promise from the Gracious (God)?
Nay! We shall note down what he says and We shall greatly prolong for him the punishment.
"And We shall inherit of him all that of which he talks, and he shall come to Us all alone."
"And they have taken (other) gods beside Allah, that they may be (a source of) power for them."
"Not at all! They will reject their worship, and become their opponents."
Seest thou not that We have sent satans against the disbelievers goading them on (to acts of disobedience)?
So be not thou in haste with regard to them; We are keeping full account of their (doings).
 (Remember) the day when We shall gather the righteous before the Gracious (God) as (honoured) guests(.)
And We shall drive the guilty to Hell like a herd (of thirsty camels).
None will have the power of intercession save he who has received a promise from the Gracious (God).
"And they say, ‘The Gracious (God) has taken unto Himself a son.’"
"Assuredly, you have done a most monstrous thing!"
"The heavens might well-nigh burst thereat, and the earth cleave asunder, and the mountains fall down in pieces,"
Because they ascribe a son to the Gracious (God.)
Whereas it becomes not the Gracious (God) to take unto Himself a son.
There is none in the heavens and the earth but he shall come to the Gracious (God) as a bondman.
"Verily, He comprehends them (by His knowledge) and has numbered them all fully."
And each of them shall come to Him singly on the Day of Resurrection.
Those who believe and do good deeds — the Gracious (God) will create love in their (hearts).
"So We have made it (the Qur’an) easy in thy tongue that thou mayest give thereby good tidings to the righteous, and warn thereby a people given to contention."
"And how many a generation have We destroyed before them! Canst thou see a single one of them, or hear (even) a whisper of them?"
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
Ta Ha.
"We have not sent down the Qur’an to thee that thou shouldst be distressed,"
"But as an exhortation for him who fears (God),"
 (And) a revelation from Him Who created the earth and the high heavens.
 (He is) the Gracious (God Who) has settled Himself on the Throne.
"To Him belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, and whatsoever is between them, and whatsoever is beneath the moist subsoil."
"And if thou speakest aloud, (it makes no difference), for He knows the secret (thought) and (what is yet) more hidden."
Allah — there is no God but He. His are the most beautiful names.
And has the story of Moses come to thee?
"When he saw a fire, he said to his family, ‘Tarry ye, I perceive a fire; perhaps I may bring you a brand therefrom or find guidance at the fire.’"
"And when he came to it, he was called (by a voice), ‘O Moses,"
"‘Verily, I am thy Lord. So take off thy shoes; for thou art in the sacred Valley of Tuwa."
‘And I have chosen thee; so hearken to what is revealed.
"‘Verily, I am Allah; there is no God beside Me. So serve Me, and observe Prayer for My remembrance."
"‘Surely, the Hour is coming; I am going to manifest it, that every soul may be recompensed for its endeavour."
"‘So let not him who believes not therein and follows his own evil inclinations, turn thee away therefrom, lest thou perish."
"‘And what is that in thy right hand, O Moses?’"
"He replied, ‘This is my rod, I lean on it, and beat down therewith leaves for my sheep, and I have (also) other uses for it.’"
"He said, ‘Cast it down, O Moses.’"
"So he cast it down, and behold! it was a serpent running."
" (God) said, ‘Catch hold of it, and fear not. We shall restore it to its former condition."
"‘And draw thy hand close under thy armpit. It shall come forth white, without any disease — another Sign,"
‘That We may show thee some of Our greater Signs.
‘Go thou to Pharaoh; he has indeed exceeded (all) bounds.’
" (Moses) said, ‘My Lord, open out for me my breast,"
"‘And ease for me my task,"
"‘And loose the knot of my tongue,"
"‘That they may understand my speech,"
‘And grant me a helper from my family — 
"‘Aaron, my brother;"
"‘Increase my strength with him,"
"‘And make him share my task,"
"‘That we may glorify Thee much,"
‘And remember Thee much.
‘Thou possessest full knowledge of us.’
" (God) said, “Granted is thy prayer, O Moses!"
"“And We did indeed confer a favour upon thee at another time (also),"
"“When We revealed to thy mother what was an (important) revelation, (saying),"
"“‘Put him in the ark, and throw it into the river, then the river will cast it on to the bank, (and one who is) an enemy to Me and also an enemy to him will take him up.’ And I wrapped thee with love from Me; and (this I did) that thou mightest be reared before My eye."
"“When thy sister walked along and said, ‘Shall I guide you to one who will take charge of him?’ So We restored thee to thy mother that her eye might be cooled and she might not grieve. And thou didst kill a man, but We delivered thee from sorrow. Then We proved thee in various ways. And thou didst tarry several years among the people of Midian. Then thou camest up to the standard, O Moses."
“And I have chosen thee for Myself.
"“Go, thou and thy brother, with My Signs, and slacken not in remembering Me."
"“Go, both of you, to Pharaoh, for he has transgressed (all) bounds."
“But speak to him a gentle speech that he might possibly heed or fear.”
"They replied, ‘Our Lord, we fear lest he commit some excess against us, or exceed (all) bounds in transgression.’"
" (God) said, “Fear not; for I am with you both. I hear and I see."
"“So go ye both to him and say, ‘We are the Messengers of thy Lord; so let the children of Israel go with us; and afflict them not. We have indeed brought thee a Sign from thy Lord; and peace shall be on him who follows the guidance;"
‘It has indeed been revealed to us that punishment shall come on him who rejects and turns away.’”
" (Pharaoh) said, ‘Who then is the Lord of you two, O Moses?’"
"He said, ‘Our Lord is He Who gave unto everything its (proper) form (and) then guided (it to its proper function).’"
" (Pharaoh) said, ‘What then will be the fate of the former generations?’"
"He said, ‘The knowledge thereof is with my Lord (recorded) in a Book. My Lord neither errs nor forgets.’"
" (It is He) Who has made the earth for you a cradle, and has caused pathways for you to run through it; and Who sends down rain from the sky, and thereby We bring forth various kinds of vegetation."
"Eat ye and pasture your cattle. Verily, in this are Signs for those who are endued with reason."
"From it have We created you, and into it shall We cause you to return, and from it shall We bring you forth once more."
"And We did show him (Pharaoh) Our Signs, all of them; but he rejected (them) and refused (to believe)."
"He said, ‘Hast thou come to us, O Moses, to drive us out of our land by thy magic?"
‘But we shall assuredly bring thee magic the like thereof; so make an appointment between us and thyself which we shall not fail to keep — neither we nor thou — at a place alike (for us both).’
"Moses said, ‘Your appointment shall be for the day of the Festival, and let the people be assembled when the sun is risen high.’"
Then Pharaoh withdrew and concerted his plan and then came (to the place of appointment).
"Moses said to them, ‘Woe to you; forge not a lie against Allah, lest He destroy you by some punishment; and surely, he who forges a lie shall perish.’"
Then they argued their affair among themselves and conferred in secret.
"They said, ‘Certainly these two are magicians, who desire to drive you out from your land by their magic and to destroy your best traditions."
"‘Concert, therefore, your plan and then come forward arrayed. And, surely, he who gains ascendancy this day shall prosper.’"
"They said, ‘O Moses, either do thou throw (first), or we shall be the first to throw.’"
"He said, ‘Nay, throw ye.’ Then lo! their cords and their staves appeared to him, by their magic, as though they ran (about)."
And Moses conceived a fear in his mind.
"We said, ‘Fear not, for thou wilt have the upper hand."
"‘And throw that which is in thy right hand; it will swallow that which they have wrought, for that which they have wrought is only a magician’s trick. And a magician shall not thrive, come where he may.’"
"Then the magicians were made to fall down prostrate. They said, ‘We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses.’"
" (Pharaoh) said, ‘Do you believe in him before I give you leave? He must be your chief who has taught you magic. I will therefore surely cut off your hands and your feet alternately, and I will surely crucify you on the trunks of palm-trees; and you shall know which of us is severer and more abiding in punishment.’"
"They said, ‘We shall not prefer thee to the manifest Signs that have come to us, nor (shall we prefer thee) to Him Who has created us. So decree what thou wilt decree; thou canst only decree concerning this present life."
‘Surely we have believed in our Lord that He may forgive us our sins and (forgive us) the magic which thou didst force us (to use). And Allah is the Best and the Most Abiding.’
"Verily, he who comes to his Lord a sinner — for him is Hell; he shall neither die therein nor live."
"But he who comes to Him as a believer having done good deeds, for such are the highest ranks — "
"Gardens of Eternity, beneath which rivers flow; they will abide therein (for ever). And that is the recompense of those who keep themselves pure."
"And We sent a revelation to Moses, (saying), ‘Take away My servants by night, and strike for them a dry path through the sea. Thou wilt not be afraid of being overtaken, nor wilt thou have (any other) fear.’"
"Then Pharaoh pursued them with his hosts, and there overwhelmed them of the waters of the sea that which overwhelmed them."
And Pharaoh led his people astray and did not guide them aright.
"‘O children of Israel, We delivered you from your enemy, and We made a covenant with you on the right side of the Mount, and We sent down on you Manna and Salwa."
"‘Eat of the good things that We have provided for you, and transgress not therein, lest My wrath descend upon you; and he on whom My wrath descends shall perish;"
"‘But surely I am forgiving to those who repent and believe and do good deeds, and then stick to guidance."
"‘And what has hastened thee away from thy people, O Moses?’"
"He said, ‘They are (closely) (following) in my footsteps and I have (hastened to Thee, my Lord, that) (Thou mightest be pleased.’)"
" (God) said, ‘We have tried thy people in thy absence, and the Samiri has led them astray.’"
"So Moses returned to his people indignant and sad. He said, ‘O my people, did not your Lord promise you a gracious promise? Did, then, the appointed time appear too long to you, or did you desire that wrath should descend upon you from your Lord, that you broke (your) promise to me?’"
"They said, ‘We have not broken (our) promise to thee of our own accord; but we were laden with loads of people’s ornaments and we threw them away, and likewise did the Samiri cast.’"
"Then he produced for them a calf — an image producing a lowing sound. And they said, ‘This is your God, and the God of Moses.’ So he gave up (the religion of Moses)."
"Could they not see that it returned to them no answer, and had no power to do them either harm or good?"
"And Aaron had said to them before this, ‘O my people, you have only been tried by means of it (the calf). And surely, the Gracious (God) is your Lord; so follow me and obey my command.’"
"They replied, ‘We shall not cease to worship it until Moses return to us.’"
" (Moses) said, “O Aaron, what hindered thee, when thou didst see them gone astray,"
‘From following me? Hast thou then disobeyed my command?’
"He answered, “O son of my mother seize me not by my beard, nor by (the hair of) my head. I feared lest thou shouldst say, ‘Thou hast caused a division among the children of Israel, and didst not wait for my word.’”"
" (Moses) said, ‘And what hast thou to say, O Samiri?’"
"He said, ‘I perceived what they perceived not. I (only) partly received the impress of the Messenger, but that (too) I cast away. Thus it is that my mind commended to me.’"
" (Moses) said, “Go away. It shall be thine to say throughout thy life, ‘Touch (me) not;’ and there is a promise of (punishment) for thee which shall not fail to be fulfilled about thee. Now look at thy god of which thou hast become a devoted worshipper. We will certainly burn it and then scatter it away into the sea.”"
"Your God is only Allah, beside Whom there is no God. He embraces all things in (his) knowledge."
Thus do We relate to thee the tidings of what has happened before. And We have given thee from Us a Reminder.
"Whoso turns away from it will surely bear a (heavy) burden on the Day of Resurrection,"
"Abiding thereunder; and evil will the burden be to them on the Day of Resurrection,"
"The day when the trumpet will be blown. And on that day We shall gather the sinful together, blue-eyed."
They will talk to one another in a low tone (saying): ‘You tarried only ten (days)’ — 
"We know best what they will say — when the one possessing the best way of life among them will say, ‘You have tarried only a day.’"
"And they ask thee concerning the mountains. Say, ‘My lord will break them into pieces and scatter them as dust."
"‘And He will leave them as a barren, level plain,"
"‘Wherein thou wilt see no depression, or elevation.’"
"On that day they will follow the Caller (straight), there being no deviation therefrom; and (all) voices shall be hushed before the Gracious (God) and thou shalt not hear but a subdued sound of footsteps."
On that day intercession shall not avail (any person) save him in whose case the Gracious (God) grants permission and with whose word (of faith) He is pleased.
"He knows (all) that is before them and (all) that is behind them, but they cannot compass it with (their) knowledge."
"And (all) faces shall humble themselves before the Living, the Self-Subsisting and All-Sustaining (God). And he shall indeed perish who bears (the burden of) iniquity."
"But he who does good works, being a believer, will have no fear of injustice or loss."
"And thus have We sent it down — the Qur’an in Arabic — and  We have explained therein certain warnings, that they may fear God or that it may give birth to (divine) remembrance in them."
"Exalted then is Allah, the True King! And be not impatient for the Qur’an ere its revelation is completed unto thee, but (only) say, ‘O my Lord, increase me in knowledge.’"
"And verily, We had made a covenant with Adam beforehand, but he forgot, and We found in him no determination (to disobey)."
"And when We said to the angels, ‘Submit to Adam,’ and they all submitted. But Iblis (did not). He refused."
"Then We said, ‘O Adam, this is an enemy to thee, and to thy wife; so let him not drive you both out of the garden, lest thou come to grief."
"‘It is (provided) for thee that thou wilt not hunger therein, nor wilt thou be naked."
"‘And that thou wilt not thirst therein, nor wilt thou be exposed to the sun.’"
"But Satan whispered evil suggestions to him; he said, ‘O Adam, shall I lead thee to the tree of eternity and to a kingdom that never decays?’"
"Then they both ate thereof, so that their shame became manifest to  them, and they began to stick the leaves of the garden together over themselves. And Adam observed not the commandment of his Lord, so his life became miserable.  "
"Then his Lord chose him (for His grace), and turned to him with mercy and guided (him)."
"He said, ‘Go forth, both of you, from here, some of you being enemies of others. And if there comes to you guidance from Me, then whoso will follow My guidance, he will not go astray, nor will he come to grief."
"‘But whosoever will turn away from My Reminder, his will be a strait life, and on the Day of Resurrection We shall raise him up blind.’"
"He will say, ‘My Lord, why hast Thou raised me up blind, while I possessed sight (before)?’"
" (God) will say, ‘Thus (it was to be); Our Signs came to thee and thou didst disregard them; and in like manner wilt thou be disregarded this day.’"
And thus do We recompense him who is extravagant and believes not in the Signs of his Lord; and the punishment of the Hereafter is surely severer and more lasting.
"Does it not afford guidance to them how many generations We destroyed before them, in whose dwellings they (now) walk? Therein verily are Signs for those who are endued with reason."
"And had it not been for a word already gone forth from thy Lord, and a term (already) fixed, (immediate punishment) would have been inevitable."
"Bear patiently then what they say, and glorify thy Lord with (His) praise before the rising of the sun and before its setting; and glorify (Him) in the hours of the night and at the sides of the day, that thou mayest find (true) happiness."
And strain not thy eyes after what We have bestowed on some classes of them to enjoy (for a short time) — the splendour of the present world — that We may try them thereby. And the provision of thy Lord is better and more lasting.
"And enjoin Prayer on thy people, and be constant therein. We ask thee not for provision; it is We that provide for thee. And the end is for righteousness."
"And they say, ‘Why does he not bring us a Sign from his Lord?’ Has there not come to them the clear evidence in what is (contained) in the former Books?"
"And if We had destroyed them with a punishment before it they would have surely said, ‘Our Lord, wherefore didst Thou not send to us a Messenger that we might have followed Thy commandments before we were humbled and disgraced?’"
"Say, ‘Each one is waiting; wait ye, therefore, and you will know who are the people of the right path and who follow (true) guidance.’"
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"Nigh has drawn for men their reckoning, yet they turn away in heedlessness."
"There comes not to them any new admonition from their Lord, but they listen to it while they make sport (of it)."
" (And) their hearts are forgetful. And they keep their counsels secret — those who act wrongfully, (then say), ‘Is this (man) aught but a human being like ourselves? Will you then accede to magic while you see (it)?’"
" (God) said (to the Prophet), “(Say), ‘My Lord knows what is spoken in the heaven and the earth. And He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing,’”"
"Nay, they say, ‘(These are but) confused dreams; nay, he has forged it; nay, he is (but) a poet. Let him then bring us a Sign just as the former (Prophets) were sent (with Sign).’"
"No township, before them, which We destroyed, ever believed. Would they then believe?"
"And We sent none (as Messengers) before thee but men to whom We sent revelations. So ask the people of the Reminder, if you know not."
"And We did not give them bodies that ate no food, nor were they to live for ever."
Then We fulfilled to them (Our) promise; and We saved them and those whom We pleased; and We destroyed the transgressors.
We have now sent down to you a Book wherein lies your (glory and) eminence; will you not then understand?
"And how many a township that acted wrongfully have We utterly destroyed, and raised up after it another people!"
"And when they felt Our punishment, lo, they began to flee from it."
"‘Flee not, but return to the comforts in which you exulted, and to your dwellings that you might be (approached and) consulted (as before).’"
"They said, ‘Alas for us, we were indeed wrongdoers!’"
"And this ceased not to be their cry till We mowed them down, reduced to ashes."
And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between the two in play.
"If We had wished to find a pastime, We would surely have found it in what is with Us if at all We were to do (such a thing)."
"Nay, We hurl the truth at falsehood, and it breaks its head, and lo, it perishes. And woe be to you for that which you ascribe (to God)."
"To Him belongs whosoever is in the heavens and the earth. And those who are in His presence do not disdain to worship Him, nor do they weary;"
They glorify (Him) night and day; (and) they flag not.
Have they taken gods from the earth who raise the dead?
"If there had been in them (the heavens and the earth) other gods beside Allah, then surely both would have gone to ruin. Glorified then be Allah, the Lord of the Throne, above what they attribute."
"He cannot be questioned as to what He does, but they will be questioned."
"Have they taken gods beside Him? Say, ‘Bring forth your proof. Here is the Book of those with me, and the Book of those before me.’ Nay, most of them know not the truth, and so they turn away."
"And We sent no Messenger before thee but We revealed to him, (saying), ‘There is no God but I; so worship Me (alone).’"
"And they say, ‘The Gracious (God) has taken to Himself a son.’ Holy is He. Nay, they are (only) honoured servants."
"They speak not before He speaks, and they act (only) by His command."
"He knows what is before them and what is behind them, and they intercede not except for him whom He approves, and they act cautiously for fear of Him."
"And whosoever of them should say, ‘I am a God beside Him,’ him shall We requite with Hell. Thus do We requite the wrongdoers."
"Do not the disbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were (a) closed-up (mass), then We opened them out? And We made from water every living thing. Will they not then believe?"
"And We have made in the earth firm mountains lest it should quake with them; and We have made therein wide pathways, that they may be rightly guided."
"And We have made the heaven a roof, well protected; yet they turn away from its Signs."
"And He it is Who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon, each gliding along in (its) orbit."
"We granted not everlasting life to any human being before thee. If then thou shouldst die, shall they live (here) for ever?"
Every soul shall taste of death; and We prove you with evil and good by way of trial. And to Us shall you be returned.
"And when the disbelievers see thee, they only make a jest of thee. (They say): ‘Is this the one who makes (an evil) mention of your gods?’ While it is they themselves who reject (with disdain) the mention of the Gracious (God)."
Man is made of haste. I will (certainly) show you My Signs but ask Me not to hasten.
"And they say, ‘When will this promise (be fulfilled), if you are truthful?’"
"If only the disbelievers knew the time when they will not be able to keep off the fire from their faces nor from their backs, and they will not be helped!"
"Nay, it will come upon them unawares so that it will utterly confound them; and they will not be able to repel it, nor will they be given respite."
"And Messengers have indeed been mocked at before thee, but that whereat they mocked encompassed those of them who scoffed."
"Say, ‘Who can protect you by night and by day from the Gracious (God)?’ Yet they turn away from the remembrance of their Lord."
"Have they any gods that can protect them beside Us? They cannot help themselves, nor can they be befriended (by any one) against Us."
"Nay, We provided those and their fathers (with the good things of this world) till life grew long for them. Do they not see that We are visiting the land, reducing it from its outlying borders? Can they even then be victors?"
"Say, ‘I warn you not but according to (divine) revelation.’ But the deaf cannot hear the call when they are warned."
"And if even a breath of thy Lord’s punishment touch them, they will surely cry out, ‘Woe to us! we were indeed wrongdoers.’"
"And We shall set up (accurate) scales of justice for the Day of Resurrection so that no soul will be wronged in aught. And even if it were the weight of a grain of mustard seed, We would bring it forth. And sufficient are We as reckoners."
"And We gave Moses and Aaron the Discrimination and a Light and a Reminder for the righteous,"
"Those who fear their Lord in secret, and who dread the Hour (of Judgment)."
And this is a blessed Reminder that We have sent down; will you then reject it?
And before (this) We gave Abraham his guidance and We knew him well.
"When he said to his father and his people, ‘What are these images to which you are so devoted?’"
"They replied, ‘We found our fathers worshipping them.’"
"He said, ‘Indeed, you yourselves as well as your fathers have been in manifest error.’"
"They said, ‘Is it (really) the truth that thou hast brought us, or art thou one of those who jest?’"
"He replied, ‘Nay, your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, He Who made them; and I am one of those who bear witness to that."
"‘And, by Allah, I will certainly plan against your idols after you have gone away (and) turned your backs.’"
"So he broke them to pieces, (all) except the chief of them, that they might return to it (for enquiry)."
"They said, ‘Who has done this to our gods? Surely, he must be a wrongdoer.’"
"They said, ‘We heard a young man speak (ill) of them; he is called Abraham.’"
"They said, ‘Then bring him before the eyes of the people, that they may bear witness.’"
" (Then) they said (to Abraham), ‘Is it thou who hast done this to our gods, O Abraham?’"
"He replied, ‘Aye, somebody has surely done this. Here is their chief. But ask them if they can speak.’"
"Then they turned towards one another and said, ‘You yourselves are surely in the wrong.’"
"And their heads were made to hang low (for shame and they said), ‘Certainly thou knowest well that these do not speak.’"
"He said, ‘Do you then worship instead of Allah that which cannot profit you at all, nor harm you?"
‘Fie on you and on that which you worship instead of Allah! Will you not then understand?’
"They said, ‘Burn him and help your gods, if (at all) you (mean to) do (anything).’"
"We said, ‘O fire, be thou cold and a (means of) safety for Abraham!’"
"And they had sought to do evil to him, but We made them the worst losers."
And We saved him and Lot (and brought them) to the land which We blessed for the peoples.
"And We bestowed upon him Isaac, and as a grandson, Jacob, and We made all (of them) righteous."
"And We made them leaders who guided (people) by Our command, and We sent revelation to them (enjoining) the doing of good works, and the observing of Prayer, and the giving of alms. And they were worshippers of Us (alone)."
And to Lot We gave wisdom and knowledge. And We saved him from the city which practised abominations. They were indeed a wicked (and) rebellious people.
And We admitted him to Our mercy; surely he was (one) of the righteous.
"And (remember) Noah when he cried (to Us) aforetime, and We heard his prayer and delivered him and his family from the great distress."
And We helped him against the people who rejected Our Signs. They were surely a wicked people; so We drowned them all.
And (remember) David and Solomon when they exercised their (respective) judgements concerning the crop when the sheep of (certain) people strayed therein (by night); and We were witness to their judgment.
We gave Solomon the (right) understanding of (the matter) and to each of them gave We wisdom and knowledge. And We subjected the mountains and the birds to celebrate (God’s) praises with David. And it is We Who do (all such things).
"And We taught him the making of coats of mail for you, that they might protect you form each other’s violence. Will you then be thankful?"
"And (We subjected) to Solomon the violent wind. It blew, at his bidding, toward the land which We had blessed. And We have knowledge of all things."
"And (We subjected to him) deep divers who dived for him, and did other work beside that; and it was We Who guarded them."
"And (remember) Job when he cried to his Lord, (saying), ‘Affliction has touched me, and Thou art the Most Merciful of all who show mercy.’"
"So We heard his prayer and removed the distress from which he suffered, and We gave him his family and the like thereof with them, as a mercy from Us, and as a reminder for the worshippers."
"And (remember) Ishmael, and Idris, and Dha’l-Kifl. All were of the steadfast."
"And We admitted them to Our mercy. Surely, they were of the righteous."
"And (remember) Dha’l-Nun, when he went away in anger, and he thought that We would never cause him distress and he cried out in (depths of) darkness, (saying), ‘There is no God but Thou, Holy art Thou. I have indeed been of the wrongdoers.’"
So We heard his prayer and delivered him from the distress. And thus do We deliver the believers.
"And (remember) Zachariah when he cried to his Lord, (saying), ‘My Lord, leave me not childless, and Thou art the Best of inheritors.’"
"So We heard his prayer and bestowed upon him John and cured his wife for him. They used to vie with one another in good works and they called on Us in hope and in fear, and they humbled themselves before Us."
And (remember) her who preserved her chastity; so We breathed into her of Our word and We made her and her son a Sign for peoples.
"Verily, this is your people —  one people; and I am your Lord, so worship Me."
But they have become divided among themselves in their affair; and all will return to Us.
"So whoever does good works and is a believer, his effort will not be disregarded and We shall surely record it."
And it is an inviolable law for a township which We have destroyed that they shall not return.
 (It shall be so) even when Gog and Magog are let loose and they shall hasten forth from every height.
"And the true promise draws nigh; then behold, the eyes of those who disbelieve will fixedly stare (and they will say), ‘Alas for us! we were indeed heedless of this; nay, we were wrongdoers!’"
"‘Surely, you and that which you worship beside Allah are the fuel of Hell. To it shall you (all) come.’"
"If these had been gods, they would not have come to it; and all will abide therein."
"Therein, groaning will be their (lot) and they will not hear therein (anything else)."
" (But) as for those for whom (the promise of) a good reward has already gone forth from Us, these will be removed far from it."
They will not hear the slightest sound thereof; and they shall abide in that which their souls desire.
"The Great Terror will not grieve them, and the angels will meet them, (saying), ‘This is your day which you were promised.’"
" (Remember) the day when We shall roll up the heavens like the rolling up of written scrolls by a scribe. As We began the first creation, so shall We repeat it — a promise (binding) upon Us; We shall certainly perform it."
"And already have We written in the Book (of David), after the exhortation, that My righteous servants shall inherit the land."
"Herein, surely, is a message for people who worship (God)."
And We have sent thee not but as a mercy for all peoples.
"Say, ‘Surely it has been revealed to me that your God is but One God. Will you then submit?’"
"But if they turn back, say, ‘I have warned you all alike and I know not whether that which you are promised is near or distant."
"‘Verily, He knows what is open in speech, and He knows that which you conceal."
"‘And I know not but that it may be a trial for you, and (only) an enjoyment for a while.’"
"He (also) said, ‘My Lord, judge Thou with truth. Our Lord is the Gracious (God) Whose help is to be sought against that which you assert.’"
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"O people, fear your Lord; verily the earthquake of the Hour is a tremendous thing — "
"The day when you see it, every woman giving suck shall forget her suckling and every pregnant woman shall cast her burden; and thou shalt see men as drunken while they will not be drunken, but severe will indeed be the punishment of Allah."
"And among men there are some who dispute concerning Allah without knowledge, and follow every rebellious satan,"
"For whom it is decreed that whosoever makes friends with him, him he will lead astray and will guide him to the punishment of the Fire."
"O people, if you are in doubt concerning the Resurrection, (then consider that) We have indeed created you from dust, then from a spermdrop, then from clotted blood, then from a lump of flesh, partly formed and partly unformed, in order that We may make (Our power) manifest to you. And We cause what We will to remain in the wombs for an appointed term; then We bring you forth as babes; then (We rear you) that  you may attain to your (age of) full strength. And there are some of you who are caused to die (prematurely), and there are others among you who are driven to the worst part of life (with the result) that they know nothing after (having had) knowledge. And thou seest the earth lifeless, but when We send down water thereon, it stirs and swells, and grows every kind of beauteous vegetation."
"That is because Allah is the Truth, and that it is He Who brings the dead to life, and that He has power over all things;"
"And because the Hour will (certainly) come, there is no doubt about it, and because Allah will raise up those who are in the graves."
"And among men there is he who disputes concerning Allah without knowledge and without guidance and without an enlightening Book,"
"Turning his side (disdainfully), that he may lead (men) astray from the way of Allah. For him is disgrace in this world; and on the Day of Resurrection We shall make him taste the punishment of burning."
"This is because of what thy hands have sent on before, and Allah is not unjust to (His) servants."
"And among men there is he who serves Allah, (standing as it were) on the verge. Then if good befall him,  he is content therewith; and if there befall him a trial, he returns to his (former) way. He loses in this world as well as in the Hereafter. That is an evident loss."
"He calls beside Allah on that which can neither harm him, nor benefit him. That is indeed straying far away."
"He calls on him whose harm is nearer than his benefit. Evil indeed is the patron, and evil indeed the associate."
"Verily, Allah will cause those who believe and do good deeds to enter Gardens beneath which rivers flow; surely Allah does what He will."
"Whoso thinks that Allah will not help him (the Prophet) in this world and the Hereafter, let him, (if he can), find a way to heaven, and let him cut off (the divine help). Then let him see if his device can remove that which enrages (him)."
"And thus have We sent it (the Qur’an) down as manifest Signs, and surely Allah guides whom He will."
" (As to) those who believe, and the Jews, and the Sabians, and the Christians, and the Magians and the idolaters, verily, Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection; surely Allah is Witness over all things."
"Hast thou not seen that to Allah submits whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is in the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and the beasts, and many of mankind?  But there are many who become deserving of punishment. And whomsoever Allah disgraces, none can raise him to honour. Verily, Allah does what He pleases."
"These two are two disputants who dispute concerning their Lord. As for those who disbelieve, garments of fire will be cut out for them; (and) boiling water will be poured down on their heads,"
"Whereby that which is in their bellies, and (their) skins too, will be melted;"
And for them there will be maces of iron (with which to punish them.)
"Whenever they will seek to get out of it from anguish, they will be turned back into it: and (it will be said to them), ‘Taste ye the punishment of burning!’"
"But Allah will cause those who believe and do good deeds to enter Gardens beneath which rivers flow. They will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold, and with pearls; and their raiment therein will be of silk."
"And they will be guided to pure speech, and they will be guided to the path of the Praiseworthy (God)."
" (As to) those who disbelieve, and hinder (men) from the way of Allah and from the Sacred Mosque, which We have appointed equally for all men, be they dwellers therein or visitors from the desert, and whoso seeks wrongfully to deviate therein (from the right path) — We shall cause them to taste of a grievous punishment."
"And (remember the time) when We assigned to Abraham the site of the House (and said), ‘Associate not anything with Me, and keep My House clean for those who perform the circuits, and those who stand up and those who bow down (and) fall prostrate (in Prayers);"
"‘And proclaim unto mankind the Pilgrimage. They will come to thee on foot, and on every lean camel, coming by every distant track,"
"‘That they may witness (its) benefits for them and may mention the name of Allah, during the appointed days, over the quadrupeds of (the class of) cattle that He has provided for them. Then eat ye thereof and feed the distressed, the needy."
"‘Then let them accomplish their needful acts of cleansing, and fulfill their vows, and go around the Ancient House.’"
"That is (God’s commandment.) And whoso honours the sacred things of Allah, it will be good for him with his Lord. And cattle are made lawful to you but not that which has been announced to you. Shun therefore the abomination of idols, and shun all words of untruth,"
"Remaining ever inclined to Allah, not associating anything with Him. And whoso associates anything with Allah, falls, as it were, from a height, and the birds snatch him up, or the wind blows him away to a distant place."
That (is so). And whoso respects the sacred Signs of Allah — that indeed (proceeds) from the righteousness of hearts.
"In them (offerings) are benefits for you for an appointed term, then their place of sacrifice is at the Ancient House."
"And to every people We appointed rites of sacrifice, that they might mention the name of Allah over the quadrupeds of (the class of) cattle that He has provided for them. So your God is One God; therefore submit ye (all) to Him. And give thou glad tidings to the humble,"
"Whose hearts are filled with fear when Allah is mentioned, and who patiently endure whatever befalls them, and who observe Prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them."
"And among the sacred Signs of Allah We have appointed for you the sacrificial camels. In them there is (much) good for you. So mention the name of Allah over them as they stand tied up in lines. And when they fall down (dead) on their sides, eat thereof and feed him who is (needy but) contented and him who supplicates. Thus have We subjected them to you, that you may be thankful."
"Their flesh reaches not Allah, nor does their blood, but it is your righteousness that reaches Him. Thus has He subjected them to you, that you may glorify Allah for His guiding you. And give glad tidings to those who do good."
"Surely, Allah defends those who believe. Surely, Allah loves not any one who is perfidious (or) ungrateful."
"Permission (to fight) is given to those against whom war is made, because they have been wronged —  and Allah indeed has power to help them — "
"Those who have been driven out from their homes unjustly only because they said, ‘Our Lord is Allah’ — And if Allah did not repel some men by means of others, there would surely have been pulled down cloisters and churches and synagogues and mosques, wherein the name of Allah is oft commemorated. And Allah will surely help one who helps Him. Allah is indeed Powerful, Mighty — "
"Those who, if We establish them in the earth, will observe Prayer and pay the Zakat and enjoin good and forbid evil. And with Allah rests the final issue of all affairs."
"And if they accuse thee of falsehood, even so, before them, the people of Noah and (the tribes of) ‘Ad and Thamud (also) accused (their Prophets) of falsehood."
 (So did) the people of Abraham and the people of Lot;
"And the inhabitants of Midian. And Moses (too) was accused of falsehood. But I gave respite to the disbelievers; then I seized them, and how (terrible) was the change I (effected in them)!"
"And how many a city have We destroyed, while it was given to wrongdoing, so that it is fallen down on its roofs; and (how many a) deserted well and lofty castle!"
"Have they not travelled in the land, so that they may have hearts wherewith to understand, or ears wherewith to hear? But (the fact is that) it is not the eyes that are blind, but it is the hearts which are in the breasts that are blind."
"And they ask thee to hasten on punishment, but Allah will never break His promise. And verily, a day with thy Lord is as a thousand years of your reckoning."
"And how many a city there is to which I gave respite, while it was given to wrongdoing. Then I seized it, and unto Me is the return."
"Say, ‘O mankind, I am but a plain Warner to you.’"
"Those who believe and do good works, for them is forgiveness and an honourable provision."
"But those who strive against Our Signs, seeking to frustrate (Our purpose) — these shall be the inmates of the Fire."
"Never sent We a Messenger or a Prophet before thee, but when he sought (to attain what he aimed at), Satan put (obstacles) in (the way of) what he sought after. But Allah removes (the obstacles) that are placed by Satan. Then Allah firmly establishes His Signs. And Allah is All-Knowing, Wise."
 (He permits this) that He may make (the obstacles) which Satan puts (in the way of the Prophets) a trial for those in whose hearts is a disease and those whose hearts are hardened —  and surely the wrongdoers are gone far (in error) — 
"And that those to whom knowledge has been given may know that it is the truth from thy Lord, so that they may believe therein and their hearts may become lowly unto Him. And surely Allah guides those who believe to the right path."
And those who disbelieve will not cease to be in doubt about it until the Hour comes suddenly upon them or there comes to them the punishment of a destructive day.
The kingdom on that day shall be Allah’s. He will judge between them. So those who believe and do good deeds will be in Gardens of Delight.
"But those who disbelieve and reject Our Signs, will have an humiliating punishment."
"And those who leave their homes for the cause of Allah, and are then slain or die, Allah will surely provide for them a goodly provision. And surely Allah is the Best of providers."
"He will surely cause them to enter a place with which they will be well pleased. And Allah is indeed All-Knowing, Forbearing."
"That (shall be so). And whoso retaliates with the like of that with which he has been afflicted and is then transgressed against, Allah will surely help him. Allah is indeed the Effacer of sins (and) is Forgiving."
"That is because Allah causes the night to enter into the day, and causes the day to enter into the night, and because Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing."
"That is because it is Allah Who is the Truth, and that which they call on beside Him is falsehood, and because Allah is the High, the Great."
"Hast thou not seen that Allah sends down water from the sky and the earth becomes green? Allah is indeed the Knower of subtleties, the All-Aware."
"To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And surely Allah is Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy."
"Hast thou not seen that Allah has subjected to you whatever is in the earth, and the ships that sail through the sea by His command? And He withholds the rain from falling on the earth save by His leave. Surely, Allah is Compassionate (and) Merciful to men."
"And He it is Who gave you life, then He will cause you to die, then will He give you life (again). Surely, man is most ungrateful."
"To every people have We appointed ways of worship which they observe; so let them not dispute with thee in the matter; and invite thou to thy Lord, for surely, thou followest the right guidance."
"And if they contend with thee, say, ‘Allah knows best what you do."
‘Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection concerning that about which you used to differ.’
"Dost thou not know that Allah knows whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth? Surely, it is (all preserved) in a Book, (and) that is easy for Allah."
"And they worship beside Allah that for which He has sent down no authority, and that of which they have no knowledge. And for those that do wrong there is no helper."
"And when Our clear Signs are recited unto them, thou wilt notice a denial on the faces of those who  disbelieve. They would well-nigh attack those who recite Our Signs to them. Say, ‘Shall I tell you of something worse than that? (It is) the Fire! Allah has promised it to those who disbelieve. And a vile destination it is!’"
"O men, a similitude is set forth, so listen to it. Surely, those on whom you call instead of Allah cannot create (even) a fly, though they combine together for the purpose. And if the fly should snatch away anything from them, they cannot recover it therefrom. Weak indeed are (both) the seeker and the sought."
"They esteem not Allah with the estimation which is His due. Surely, Allah is Powerful, Mighty."
"Allah chooses (His) Messengers from among angels, and from among men. Surely, Allah is All- Hearing, All-Seeing."
He knows what is before them and what is behind them; and to Allah shall (all) affairs be returned (for decision).
"O ye who believe! bow down and prostrate yourselves in Prayer, and worship your Lord, and do good deeds that you may prosper."
"And strive in the cause of Allah as it behoves you to strive for it. He has chosen you, and has laid no hardship upon you in religion; (so follow) the faith of your father Abraham; He named you Muslims (both) before and in this (Book), so that the Messenger may be a witness over you, and that you may be  witnesses over mankind. Therefore observe Prayer and pay the Zakat, and hold fast to Allah. He is your Master. An excellent Master and an excellent Helper!"
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"Surely, success does come to the believers,"
"Who are humble in their Prayers,"
"And who shun all that which is vain,"
"And who are active in paying the Zakat,"
And who guard their chastity — 
"Except from their wives or what their right hands possess, for then they are not to be blamed;"
But those who seek (anything) beyond that are the transgressors — 
"And who are watchful of their trusts and their covenants,"
And who are strict in the observance of their Prayers.
"These are the heirs,"
Who will inherit Paradise. They will abide therein.
"Verily, We created man from an extract of clay;"
Then We placed him as a drop of sperm in a safe depository;
"Then We fashioned the sperm into a clot; then We fashioned the clot into a (shapeless) lump; then We fashioned bones out of this (shapeless) lump;  then We clothed the bones with flesh; then We developed it into another creation. So blessed be Allah, the Best of creators."
Then after that you must surely die.
Then on the Day of Resurrection will you be raised up.
"And We have created above you seven (heavens) lying one above the other, and We are never neglectful of the creation."
"And We sent down water from the sky according to measure, and We caused it to stay in the earth —  and surely it is We Who determine its taking away — "
And We produced for you thereby gardens of date-palms and vines; for you therein are abundant fruits; and of them you eat.
And a tree which springs forth from Mount Sinai; it produces oil and a sauce for those who eat.
"And in the cattle (also) there is a lesson for you. We give you to drink of that which is in their bellies and you have in them many benefits, and of them you (also) eat;"
And on them and on ships you are borne.
"And We did send Noah to his people, and he said, ‘O my people, serve Allah. You have no God other than Him. Will you not then be righteous?’"
"And the chiefs of his people, who disbelieved, said, ‘He is only a man like yourselves; he seeks to make himself superior to you. And if  Allah had so willed, He could have surely sent down angels (with him.) We have never heard of such (a thing) among our forefathers."
"‘He is only a man (stricken) with madness; wait, therefore, concerning him for a while.’"
"He said, ‘O my Lord, help me, for they have treated me as a liar.’"
"So We sent revelation to him, (saying), “Make the Ark under Our eyes and (according to) Our revelation. And when Our command comes, and the fountains (of the earth) gush forth, take thou into it two of every kind, male and female, and thy family, except those of them against whom the word has already gone forth. And address Me not concerning those who have done wrong; they shall be drowned."
"“And when thou hast settled on the Ark — thou and those that are with thee — say, ‘All praise belongs to Allah Who has saved us from the unjust people!’"
"“And say, ‘My Lord, cause me to land a blessed landing, for Thou art the Best of those who bring (men) to land.’”"
"Verily, in this there are Signs. Surely, We did try (the people of Noah.)"
Then We raised after them another generation.
"And We sent among them a Messenger from among themselves (who said), ‘Serve Allah. You have no God other than Him. Will you not then fear God?’"
"And the chiefs of his people, who disbelieved and denied the meeting of the Hereafter and whom  We had afforded ease and comfort in this life, said, ‘This is but a man like yourselves. He eats of that of which you eat, and drinks of that of which you drink."
"‘And if you obey a man like yourselves, you will then be surely losers."
"‘Does he promise you that when you are dead and have become dust and bones, you will be brought forth (again)?"
"‘Far, far (from truth) is that which you are promised."
"‘There is no life other than our present life; we were lifeless and (now) we live, but we shall not be raised up again."
‘He is only a man who has forged a lie against Allah; and we are not going to believe him.’
"He said, ‘My Lord, help me, for they have treated me as a liar.’"
" (God) said, ‘In a little while they will surely become repentant.’"
"Then punishment overtook them rightfully, and We made them (as) rubbish. Cursed, then, be the people who do wrong!"
Then We raised after them other generations.
"No people can go ahead of their appointed time, nor can they remain behind (it)."
"Then We sent Our Messengers one after another. Every time there came to a people their Messenger, they treated him as a liar. So We made them follow one another (to destruction) and We made them mere tales. Cursed, then, be the people who believe not!"
"Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron, with Our Signs and a clear authority,"
To Pharaoh and his chiefs; but they behaved arrogantly and they were a haughty people.
"And they said, ‘Shall we believe in two men like ourselves while their people are our servants?’"
"So they called them liars, and they were of those who were destroyed."
"And We gave Moses the Book, that they might be guided."
"And We made the son of Mary and his mother a Sign, and gave them refuge on an elevated land of (green) valleys and springs of running water."
"O ye Messengers, eat of the things that are pure, and do good works. Verily, I am well aware of what you do."
"And (know) that this community of yours is one community, and I am your Lord. So take Me as (your) Protector."
"But they (the people) have cut up their affairs among themselves (forming themselves into) parties, each group rejoicing in what they have."
So leave them in their confusion for a time.
"Do they think that by the wealth and children with which We help them,"
"We hasten to do them good? Nay, but they understand not."
"Verily, those who fear their Lord, (holding Him) in reverence,"
"And those who believe in the Signs of their Lord,"
"And those who ascribe not partners to their Lord,"
And those who give what they give while their hearts are full of fear because to their Lord they will return — 
"These it is who hasten to do good works, and these it is who are foremost in them."
"And We burden not any soul beyond its capacity, and with Us is a Book that speaks the truth, and they will not be wronged."
"Nay, their hearts are utterly heedless of this (Book), and besides that they have deeds in which they are engaged;"
"Until, when We seize those of them who indulge in luxury with punishment, behold, they cry for help."
"‘Cry not for help this day, surely you shall not be helped by Us."
"‘Verily, My Signs were recited unto you, but you used to turn back on your heels,"
"‘Big with pride, telling stories about it (the Qur’an) by night, talking nonsense.’"
"Have they not, then, pondered over the (Divine) Word, or has that come unto them which came not to their fathers of old?"
"Or do they not recognize their Messenger, that they (thus) deny him?"
"Or do they say, there is madness in him? Nay, he has brought them the truth, and most of them hate the truth."
"And if the Truth had followed their desires, verily, the heavens and the earth and whosoever is therein would have been corrupted. Nay, We have brought them their admonition, but from their own admonition they (now) turn aside."
Or dost thou ask of them any reward? But the reward of thy Lord is best; and He is the Best of providers.
And most surely thou invitest them to a right path.
"And those who believe not in the Hereafter, are indeed deviating from that path."
"And if We had mercy on them and relieved them of their affliction, they would still persist in their transgression, wandering blindly."
"We did seize them with punishment, but they humbled not themselves to their Lord, nor would they supplicate (in lowliness)."
"Until, when We open on them a gate of severe chastisement, behold, they are in despair thereat."
"And He it is Who has created for you ears, and eyes, and hearts; (but) little thanks do you give."
"And He it is Who has multiplied you in the earth, and unto Him shall you be gathered."
"And He it is Who gives life and causes death, and in His hands is the alternation of night and day. Will you not then understand?"
But they say like what the former people said.
"They say, ‘What! when we are dead and have become (mere) dust and bones, shall we indeed be raised up again?"
"‘This is what we have been promised before, we and our fathers. This is nothing but fables of the ancients.’"
"Say, ‘To whom belongs the earth and whosoever is therein, if you know?’"
"‘To Allah’, they will say. Say, ‘Will you not then be admonished?’"
"Say, ‘Who is the Lord of the seven heavens, and the Lord of the Great Throne?’"
"They will say, ‘(They are) Allah’s.’ Say, ‘Will you not then take (Him) as (your) Protector?’"
"Say, ‘In Whose hand is the dominion over all things and Who protects, but against Whom there is not protection, if you know?’"
"They will say, ‘(All this belongs) to Allah.’ Say, ‘How then are you deluded?’"
"Yea, We have brought them the truth, and they are certainly liars."
"Allah has not taken unto Himself any son, nor is there any (other) God along with Him; in that case each god would have taken away what he had created, and some of them would surely have dominated over others. Glorified be Allah above all that which they attribute (to Him)!"
Knower of the unseen and of the seen! Exalted therefore is He above (all) that which they associate (with Him)!
"Say, ‘My Lord, if Thou wilt show me that with which they are threatened."
"‘My Lord, then place me not with the wrongdoing people.’"
And certainly We have the power to show thee that with which We threaten them.
Repel evil with that which is best. We are well acquainted with (the things) they allege.
"And say, ‘My Lord, I seek refuge in Thee from the incitements of the evil ones."
"‘And I seek refuge in Thee, my Lord, lest they come near me.’"
"Until, when death comes to one of them, he says (entreating), ‘My Lord, send me back,"
"‘That I may do righteous (deeds) in (the life) that I have left (behind.)’ Never, it is but a word that he utters. And behind them is a barrier until the day when they shall be raised again."
"And when the trumpet is blown, there will be no ties of relationship between them that day, nor will they ask after one another."
Then those whose good works are heavy — these will be prosperous;
But those whose good works are light — these are they who ruin their souls; in Hell will they abide.
The Fire will burn their faces and they will grin (with fear) therein.
"‘Were not My Signs recited unto you, and you treated them as lies?’"
"They will say, ‘Our Lord, our wickedness overcame us, and we were an erring people."
"‘Our Lord, take us out of this, then if we return (to disobedience), we shall indeed be wrongdoers."
" (God) will say, “Away with you, despised therein, and speak not unto Me."
"“There was a party from among My servants who said, ‘Our Lord, we believe; forgive us therefore (our sins), and have mercy on us; for Thou art the Best of those who show mercy.’"
“But you made them a laughingstock until they became the cause of your forgetting My remembrance while you (continued) laughing at them.
“I have rewarded them this day for their steadfastness so that they alone have triumphed.”
" (God) will say, ‘What number of years did you tarry in the earth?’"
"They will say, ‘We tarried for a day or part of a day, but ask those who keep count.’"
"He will say, ‘You tarried but a little, if only you knew!"
"‘Did you then think that We had created you without purpose, and that you would not be brought back to Us?’"
"Exalted then be Allah, the True King. There is no God but He, the Lord of the Glorious Throne."
"And he who calls on another God along with Allah, for which he has no proof, shall have to render an account to his Lord. Certainly the disbelievers will not prosper."
"And say, ‘My Lord, forgive and have mercy, and Thou art the Best of those who show mercy.’"
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
" (This is) a Surah which We have revealed and which We have made obligatory; and We have revealed therein clear Signs, that you may take heed."
"The adulteress and the adulterer (or the fornicatress and the fornicator) —  flog each one of them with a hundred stripes. And let not pity for the twain take hold of you in (executing) the judgment of Allah, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day. And let a party of the believers witness their punishment."
"The adulterer (or fornicator) shall not marry but an adulteress (or fornicatress) or an idolatrous woman, and an adulteress (or fornicatress) shall not marry but an adulterer (or fornicator) or an idolatrous man. That indeed is forbidden to the believers."
"And those who calumniate chaste women but bring not four witnesses —  flog them with eighty stripes, and never admit their evidence (thereafter), and it is they that are the transgressors,"
"Except those who repent thereafter and make amends, for truly Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"And as for those who calumniate their wives, and have not witnesses except themselves — the evidence of any one of such people (shall suffice) if he bears witness four times in the name of Allah (saying) that he is surely of those who speak the truth."
And (his) fifth (oath shall be to say) that Allah’s curse be upon him if he be of the liars.
But it shall avert the punishment from her if she bears witness four times in the name of Allah (saying) that he is of the liars.
And (her) fifth (oath shall be to say) that the wrath of Allah be upon her if he speaks the truth.
"And were it not for Allah’s grace and His mercy upon you, and (the fact) that Allah is Compassionate (and) Wise, (you would have come to grief.)"
"Verily, those who brought forth the lie are a party from among you. Think it not to be an evil for you; nay, it is good for you. Every one of them shall have (his share of) what he has earned of the sin; and he among them who took the chief part therein shall have a grievous punishment."
"Why did not the believing men and believing women, when you heard of it, think well of their own people, and say, ‘This is a manifest lie?’"
"Why did they not bring four witnesses to (prove) it? Since they have not brought the (required) witnesses, they are indeed liars in the sight of Allah!"
"Were it not for the grace of Allah and His mercy upon you, in this world and the Hereafter, a great punishment would have befallen you for (the slander) into which you plunged."
"When you received it (and then talked about it) with your tongues, and you uttered with your mouths  that of which you had no knowledge, and you thought it to be a light matter, while in the sight of Allah it was (a) grievous (thing)."
"And wherefore did you not say, when you heard of it, ‘It is not proper for us to talk about it. Holy art Thou, (O God), this is a grievous calumny!’"
"Allah admonishes you never to return to the like thereof, if you are believers."
"And Allah explains to you the commandments; and Allah is All- Knowing, Wise."
"Those who love that immorality should spread among the believers, will have a painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter. And Allah knows, and you know not."
"And but for the grace of Allah and His mercy upon you and (the fact) that Allah is Compassionate (and) Merciful, (you would have been ruined)."
"O ye who believe! follow not the footsteps of Satan, and whoso follows the footsteps of Satan (should know that) he surely enjoins immorality and manifest evil. And but for the grace of Allah and His mercy upon you, not one of you would ever be pure, but Allah purifies whom He pleases. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
"And let not those who possess wealth and plenty among you swear not to give (aught) to the kindred and to the needy and to those who have left their homes in the cause of Allah. Let them forgive and pass  over (the offence). Do you not desire that Allah should forgive you? And Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"Verily, those who accuse chaste, unwary, believing women are cursed in this world and the Hereafter. And for them is a grievous chastisement,"
On the day when their tongues and their hands and their feet will bear witness against them as to what they used to do.
"On that day will Allah pay them their just due, and they will know that Allah alone is the Manifest Truth."
"Bad things are for bad men, and bad men are for bad things. And good things are for good men, and good men are for good things; these are innocent of all that they (calumniators) allege. For them is forgiveness and an honourable provision."
"O ye who believe! enter not houses other than your own until you have asked leave and saluted the inmates thereof. That is better for you, that you may be heedful."
"And if you find no one therein, do not enter them until you are given permission. And if it be said to you, ‘Go back’ then go back; that is purer for you. And Allah knows well what you do."
It is no sin on your part to enter uninhabited houses wherein are your goods. And Allah knows what you reveal and what you conceal.
"Say to the believing men that they restrain their eyes and guard their private parts. That is purer for them. Surely, Allah is well aware of what they do."
"And say to the believing women that they restrain their eyes and guard their private parts, and that they disclose not their (natural and artificial) beauty except that which is apparent thereof, and that they draw their head-coverings over their bosoms, and that they disclose not their beauty save to their husbands, or to their fathers, or the fathers of their husbands or their sons or the sons of their husbands or their brothers, or the sons of their brothers, or the sons of their sisters, or their women, or what their right hands possess, or such of male attendants as have no sexual appetite, or young children who have no knowledge of the hidden parts of women. And they strike not their feet so that what they hide of their ornaments may become known.  And turn ye to Allah all together, O believers, that you may succeed."
"And marry widows from among you, and your male slaves and female slaves who are fit (for marriage). If they be poor, Allah will grant them means out of His bounty; and Allah is Bountiful, All-knowing."
"And those who find no (means of) marriage should keep themselves chaste, until Allah grants them means out of His bounty. And such as desire (a deed of manumission in) writing  from among those whom your right hands possess, write it for them if you know any good in them; and give them out of the wealth of Allah which He has bestowed upon you. And force not your maids to unchaste life (by keeping them unmarried) if they desire to keep chaste, in order that you may seek the gain of the present life. But if any one forces them, then after their compulsion Allah will be Forgiving (and) Merciful (to them)."
"And We sent down to you manifest Signs, and the example of those who have passed away before you, and an exhortation to the God-fearing."
"Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The similitude of His light is as a (lustrous) niche, wherein is a lamp. The lamp is in a glass. The glass is as it were a glittering star. It is lit from a blessed tree — an olive — neither of the east nor of the west, whose oil would well-nigh glow forth even though fire touched it not. Light upon light! Allah guides to His light whomsoever He will. And Allah sets forth parables to men, and Allah knows all things full well."
 (This light is now lit) in houses with regard to which Allah has ordained that they be exalted and that His name be remembered in them. Therein is He glorified in the mornings and the evenings
" (By) men, whom neither merchandise nor traffic diverts from the remembrance of Allah and the observance of Prayer, and the giving of the Zakat. They fear a day in which hearts and eyes will be agitated,"
"So that Allah may give them the best reward of their deeds, and give them increase out of His bounty. And Allah does provide for whomsoever He pleases without measure."
"And (as to) those who disbelieve, their deeds are like a mirage in a desert. The thirsty one thinks it to be water until, when he comes up to it, he finds it to be nothing. And he finds Allah near him, Who then fully pays him his account; and Allah is swift at reckoning."
"Or (their deeds are) like thick darkness in a vast and deep sea, which a wave covers, over which there is another wave, above which are clouds: layers of darkness, one upon another. When he holds out his hand, he can hardly see it: and he whom Allah gives no light — for him there is no light at all."
"Hast thou not seen that it is Allah Whose praises all who are in the heavens and the earth celebrate, and (so do) the birds with their wings outspread? Each one knows his own (mode of) prayer and praise. And Allah knows well what they do."
"And to Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and to Allah shall be the return."
"Hast thou not seen that Allah drives the clouds, then joins them together, then piles them up so that thou seest rain issue forth from the midst thereof? And He sends down from the sky (clouds like) mountains wherein is hail, and He smites therewith whom He pleases, and turns it away from whom He pleases. The flash of its lightning may well-nigh take away the sight."
Allah alternates the night and the day. Therein surely is a lesson for those who have eyes.
"And Allah has created every animal from water. Of them are (some) that go upon their bellies, and of them are (some) that go upon two feet, and among them are (some) that go upon four. Allah creates what He pleases. Surely, Allah has the power to do all that He pleases."
We have indeed sent down manifest Signs. And Allah guides whom He pleases to the right path.
"And they say, ‘We believe in Allah and in the Messenger and we obey;’ then after that some of them turn away. But such are not believers."
"And when they are called to Allah and His Messenger that he may judge between them, lo! a party of them turn away."
"And if (they consider) the right (to be) on their side, they come to him running in (all) submission."
"Is it that there is a disease in their hearts? Or do they doubt, or do they fear that Allah and His Messenger will be unjust to them? Nay, it is they themselves who are the wrongdoers."
"The response of the believers, when they are called to Allah and His Messenger in order that he may judge between them, is only that they say: ‘We hear and we obey.’ And it is they who will prosper."
"And whoso obeys Allah and His Messenger, and fears Allah, and takes Him as a shield (for protection), it is they who will be successful."
"And they swear by Allah their strongest oaths that, if thou command them, they will surely go forth. Say, ‘Swear not; (what is required is actual) obedience in what is right. Surely, Allah is well aware of what you do.’"
"Say, ‘Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger.’ But if you turn away, then upon him is his burden, and upon you is your burden. And if you obey him, you will be rightly guided. And the messenger is not responsible but for the plain delivery of the Message."
"Allah has promised to those among you who believe and do good works that He will surely make them Successors in the earth, as He made Successors (from among) those who were before them; and that He will surely establish for them their religion which He has chosen for them; and that He will surely give them in exchange security (and peace) after their fear: They will worship Me, (and) they will not associate anything with Me. Then whoso is ungrateful after that, they will be the rebellious."
"And observe Prayer and give the Zakat and obey the Messenger, that you may be shown mercy."
Think not that those who disbelieve can frustrate (Our plan) in the earth; their abode is Hell; and it is indeed an evil resort.
"O ye who believe! let those whom your right hands possess, and those of you who have not attained to puberty, ask leave of you at three times (before coming into your presence): before the morning  Prayer, and when you take off your clothes at noon in summer, and after the night Prayer. (These are) three times of privacy for you. At (times) other than these there is no blame on you or on them, (for) they have to move about (waiting upon) you, some of you (attending) upon others. Thus does Allah make plain to you the Signs; for Allah is All-Knowing, Wise."
"And when the children among you attain to puberty, they (too) should ask permission, even as those (mentioned) before them asked permission. Thus does Allah make plain to you His commandments; and Allah is All-Knowing, Wise."
" (As to) elderly women, who have no desire for marriage — there is no blame on them if they lay aside their (outer) clothing without displaying their beauty. But to abstain (from that even) is better for them. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
"There is no harm for the blind and there is no harm for the lame, and there is no harm for the sick and none for yourselves, that you eat from your own houses, or the houses of your fathers, or the houses of your mothers or the houses of your brothers, or the houses of your sisters, or the houses of your fathers’ brothers or the houses of your fathers’ sisters, or the houses of your mothers’ brothers, or the houses of your mothers’ sisters, or (from) that of which the keys are in your possession, or (from the house of) a friend of yours. There is no harm for you whether you eat together or separately.  But when you enter houses, salute your people — a greeting from your Lord, full of blessing and purity. Thus does Allah make plain to you the commandments, that you may understand."
"Those only are (true) believers who believe in Allah and His Messenger, and who, when they are with him on some matter (of common importance) which has brought (them) together, go not away until they have asked leave of him. Surely those who ask leave of thee, it is they who (really) believe in Allah and His Messenger. So, when they ask thy leave for some affair of theirs, give leave to those of them whom thou pleasest, and ask forgiveness for them of Allah. Surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
Treat not the calling of the Messenger among you like the calling of one of you to another. Allah does know those of you who steal away covertly. So let those who go against His command beware lest a trial afflict them or a grievous punishment overtake them.
"Hearken ye! To Allah belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth. He does know in what condition you are. And on the day when they will be returned unto Him, He will inform them of what they did. And Allah knows everything full well."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"Blessed is He Who has sent down the Discrimination to His servant, that he may be a Warner to (all) the worlds — "
"He to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. And He has taken unto Himself no son, and has no partner in the kingdom, and has created everything, and has ordained for it (its) proper measure."
"Yet they have taken beside Him gods, who create nothing but are themselves created, and who have no power to harm or benefit themselves and they control not death nor life nor resurrection."
"And those who disbelieve say, ‘It is naught but a lie which he has forged, and other people have helped him with it.’ Indeed, they have brought forth an injustice and an untruth."
"And they say, ‘(These are) fables of the ancients; (and) he has got them written down, and they are dictated to him morning and evening.’"
"Say, ‘He Who knows (every) secret (that is) in the heavens and the earth has revealed it. Verily, He is Most Forgiving, Merciful.’"
"And they say, ‘What is the matter with this Messenger that he eats food, and walks in the streets? Why has not an angel been sent down to him that he might be a warner with him?"
"‘Or a treasure should have been thrown down to him, or he should have had a garden to eat therefrom.’ And the wrongdoers say, ‘You follow none but a man bewitched.’"
See how they coin similitudes for thee! Thus they have gone astray and cannot find a way.
"Blessed is He Who, if He please, will assign thee better than all that —  Gardens through which rivers flow — and will (also) assign thee palaces."
"Nay, they deny the Hour, and for those who deny the Hour We have prepared a blazing fire."
"When it sees them from a place far off, they will hear its raging and roaring."
"And when they are thrown into a narrow place thereof, chained together, they will pray there for destruction."
"‘Pray not today for one destruction, but pray for many destructions.’"
"Say, ‘Is that better or the Garden of Eternity, which is promised to the righteous? It will be their reward and resort.’"
"They will have therein whatsoever they desire, abiding (therein for ever). It is a promise from thy Lord, to be (always) prayed for."
"And the day when He will assemble them and those whom they worship beside Allah, He will ask, ‘Was it you who led astray these My servants, or did they (themselves) stray away from the path?’"
"They will say, ‘Holy art Thou! It was not proper for us to take protectors other than Thee; but Thou didst  bestow on them and their fathers the good things (of this life) until they forgot the admonition and became a ruined people.’"
" (Then We shall say to the idolaters): ‘Now have they given you the lie regarding what you said, so you cannot avert (the punishment) or (get) help.’ And whosoever among you does wrong, We shall make him taste a grievous punishment."
And We never sent any Messengers before thee but surely they ate food and walked in the streets. And We make some of you a trial for others. Will you (then) be steadfast? And thy Lord is All- Seeing.
And those who look not for a meeting with Us say: ‘Why are angels not sent down to us? Or why do we not see our Lord?’ Surely they are too proud of themselves and have greatly exceeded the bounds.
On the day when they see the angels — there will be no good tidings on that day for the guilty; and they will say: ‘Would that there were a great barrier!’
And We shall turn to the works they did and We shall scatter it into particles of dust.
"The inmates of Heaven on that day will be better off as regards (their) abode, and better off in respect of (their) place of repose."
"And the day when the heaven shall be rent asunder with the clouds, and the angels shall be sent down in large numbers — "
The true kingdom shall that day belong to the Gracious (God); and it shall be a hard day for the disbelievers.
" (Remember) the day when the wrongdoer will bite his hands; he will say, ‘O, would that I had taken (the same) way with the Messenger!"
"‘Ah, woe is me! Would that I had never taken such a one for a friend!"
‘He led me astray from the Reminder after it had come to me.’ And Satan is man’s great deserter.
"And the Messenger will say, ‘O my Lord, my people indeed treated this Qur’an as (a) discarded (thing).’"
Thus did We make for every Prophet an enemy from among the sinners; and sufficient is thy Lord as a Guide and a Helper.
"And those who disbelieve say, ‘Why was not the Qur’an revealed to him all at once?’ (We have revealed it) thus that We may strengthen thy heart therewith. And We have arranged it in the best form."
And they bring thee no similitude but We provide thee with the truth and an excellent explanation.
Those who will be gathered on their faces unto Hell — they will be the worst in plight and most astray from the (right) path.
"We gave Moses the Book, and appointed with him his brother Aaron as (his) assistant."
"And We said, ‘Go both of you to the people who have rejected Our Signs;’ then We destroyed them, an utter destruction."
"And (as to) the people of Noah when they rejected the Messengers, We drowned them, and We made them a Sign for mankind. And We have prepared a painful punishment for the wrongdoers."
"And (We destroyed) ‘Ad and Thamud, and the People of the Well, and many a generation between them."
And to each one We set forth (clear) similitudes; and each one We completely destroyed.
"And these (Meccans) must have visited the town whereon was rained an evil rain. Have they not then seen it? Nay, they hope not to be raised (after death)."
"And when they see thee, they only make a jest of thee: ‘Is this he whom Allah has sent (as) a Messenger?"
"‘He indeed had well-nigh led us astray from our gods, had we not steadily adhered to them.’ And they shall know, when they see the punishment, who is most astray from the (right) path."
Hast thou seen him who takes his own evil desire for his god? Couldst thou then be a guardian over him?
"Dost thou think that most of them hear or understand? They are only like cattle — nay, they are worst astray from the path."
"Hast thou not seen how thy Lord lengthens the shade? And if He had pleased, He could have made it stationary. Then We make the sun a guide thereof."
"Then We draw it in towards Ourself, an easy drawing in."
"And He it is Who has made the night a covering for you, and (Who has made) sleep for rest, and has made the day for rising up."
"And He it is Who sends the winds as glad tidings before His mercy, and We send down pure water from the sky,"
"That We may thereby give life to a dead land, and give it for drink to Our creation — cattle and men in great numbers."
"And We have explained it to them in diverse ways that they may take heed, but most men would reject everything but disbelief."
"If We had pleased, We could have surely raised a Warner in every city."
So obey not the disbelievers and fight against them by means of it (the Qur’an) a great fight.
"And He it is Who has caused the two seas to flow, this palatable (and) sweet, and that saltish (and) bitter; and between them He has placed a barrier and a great partition."
"And He it is Who has created man from water, and has made for him kindred by descent and kindred by marriage; and thy Lord is All- Powerful."
And they worship beside Allah that which can do them no good nor harm them. And the disbeliever is a helper (of Satan) against his Lord.
And We have not sent thee but as a bearer of glad tidings and a Warner.
"Say, ‘I ask of you no recompense for it, save that whoso chooses may take a way unto his Lord.’"
"And trust thou in the Living One, Who dies not, and glorify (Him) with His praise. And sufficient is He as the Knower of the sins of His servants,"
"He Who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six periods, then He settled Himself on the Throne. The Gracious (God)! Ask thou then concerning Him one who knows."
"And when it is said to them, ‘Submit to the Gracious (God),’ they say, ‘And who is the Gracious (God)? Shall we submit to whatever thou biddest us?’ And it increases their aversion."
Blessed is He Who has made mansions in the heaven and has placed therein a Lamp and a Moon giving light.
"And He it is Who has made the night and the day, each following the other, for him who desires to remember, or desires to be grateful."
"And the servants of the Gracious (God) are those who walk on the earth in a dignified manner, and when the ignorant address them, they say, ‘Peace!’"
"And who spend the night before their Lord, prostrate and standing,"
"And who say, ‘Our Lord, avert from us the punishment of Hell; for the punishment thereof is a lasting torment."
‘It is indeed evil as a place of rest and as an abode;’
"And those who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor niggardly but moderate between the two;"
"And those who call not on any other God along with Allah, nor kill a person that Allah has forbidden except for just cause, nor commit adultery (or fornication), and he who does that shall meet with the punishment of sin."
"Doubled to him will be the punishment on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein disgraced,"
"Except those who repent, and believe and do good deeds; for as to these, Allah will change their evil deeds into good deeds; and Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful;"
"And those who repent and do good (deeds), indeed turn to Allah with (true) repentance;"
"And those who bear not false witness, and when they pass by anything vain, they pass on with dignity;"
"And those who, when they are reminded of the Signs of their Lord, fall not deaf and blind thereat;"
"And those who say, ‘Our Lord, grant us of our wives and children the delight of (our) eyes, and make us a model for the righteous."
"It is such as will be rewarded a high place (in Paradise) because they were steadfast, and they will be received therein with greeting and peace,"
Abiding therein. Excellent it is as a place of rest and as an abode.
"Say (to the disbelievers): ‘But for your prayer (to Him) my Lord would not care for you. You have indeed rejected (the truth), and (the punishment of your rejection) will now cleave (to you).’"
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
Ta Sin Mim.
These are verses of the clear Book.
Haply thou wilt grieve thyself to death because they believe not.
"If We please, We can send down to them a Sign from the heaven, so that their necks will bow down before it."
"And there comes not to them a new Reminder from the Gracious (God), but they turn away from it."
"They have, indeed, treated (it) as a lie, but soon there will come to them the tidings of that at which they mocked."
"Have they not looked at the earth, how many of every noble species have We caused to grow therein?"
In that there is a Sign indeed; but most of these would not believe.
"And verily, thy Lord — He is the Mighty, the Merciful."
"And (remember) when thy Lord called Moses, (saying), ‘Go to the wrongdoing people — "
‘The people of Pharaoh. Will they not fear (God)?’
"He said, ‘My Lord, I fear that they will treat me as a liar;"
"‘And my breast is straitened and my tongue is not fluent; therefore, send (word) to Aaron."
"‘And they have a charge against me, so I fear that they may kill me.’"
" (God) said, “Not so, go then, both of you, with Our Signs; We are with you (and) We hear."
"“So go to Pharaoh, and say, ‘We are the Messengers of the Lord of the worlds,"
‘(To tell thee to) send the children of Israel with us.’”
" (Pharaoh) said, ‘Did we not bring thee up among us as a child? And thou didst stay among us (many) years of thy life."
"‘And thou didst do thy deed which thou didst, and thou art of the ungrateful.’"
" (Moses) said, ‘I did do it then, and I was (one) of the erring."
‘So I fled from you when I feared you; then my Lord granted me (right) judgment and made me (one) of the Messengers.
‘And this is the favour for which thou tauntest me; that thou hast enslaved the children of Israel.’
"Pharaoh said, ‘And what is the Lord of the worlds?’"
" (Moses) said, ‘The Lord of the heavens and the earth and of all that is between the two, if you would be convinced.’"
" (Pharaoh) said to those around him, ‘Do you not hear?’"
" (Moses) said, ‘Your Lord, and the Lord of your fathers of yore.’"
" (Pharaoh) said, ‘Most surely this Messenger of yours who has been sent to you is a madman.’"
" (Moses) said, ‘The Lord of the East and of the West, and of all that is between the two, if you did but understand.’"
" (Pharaoh) said, ‘If thou takest a God other than me, I will certainly put thee into prison.’"
" (Moses) said, ‘What, even though I bring thee something that is manifest!’"
" (Pharaoh) said, ‘Bring it then, if thou speakest the truth.’"
"So he threw down his rod, and behold! it was a serpent plainly visible."
"And he drew forth his hand, and lo! it was white for the beholders."
" (Pharaoh) said to the chiefs around him, ‘This is surely a skilful magician."
‘He seeks to turn you out of your land by his magic. Now what do you advise?’
"They said, ‘Put him off and his brother (awhile) and send into the cities summoners,"
‘Who should bring thee every skilful sorcerer.’
So the magicians were assembled together at the appointed time on a fixed day.
"And it was said to the people, ‘Will you (also) gather together,"
‘So that we may follow the magicians if they are the winners?’
"And, when the magicians came, they said to Pharaoh, ‘Shall we have a reward if we are the winners?’"
"He said, ‘Yes, and surely then you will be among those who are near (my person).’"
"Moses said to them, ‘(Now) throw ye what you have to throw.’"
"So they threw down their ropes and their rods, and said, ‘By Pharaoh’s honour, it is we who will surely win.’"
"Then Moses threw down his rod, and lo! it swallowed up that which they had fabricated."
Thereupon the magicians were impelled to fall down prostrate.
"They said, ‘We believe in the Lord of the worlds,"
"‘The Lord of Moses, and of Aaron.’"
" (Pharaoh) said, ‘You have believed in him before I gave you leave? He is surely your chief who has taught you magic. But you shall know (the consequences thereof). I will most surely cut off your hands and your feet on alternate sides, and I will most surely crucify you all.’"
"They said, ‘There is no harm; to our lord shall we return."
"‘We do hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins, since we are the first among the believers.’"
"And We revealed to Moses, (saying), ‘Take away My servants by night, you will surely be pursued.’"
"And Pharaoh sent summoners into the cities, (saying),"
"‘These are a small party,"
‘And they have offended us;
‘And we are a multitude (fully prepared and) vigilant.’
"So We turned them out of gardens, and springs,"
"And treasures, and an abode of honour."
Thus (indeed it was); and We gave them as heritage to the children of Israel — 
And they pursued and overtook them at sunrise.
"And when the two hosts came in sight of each other the companions of Moses said, ‘We are surely overtaken.’"
"‘Nay, (speak not thus)!’ said he, ‘My Lord is with me. He will direct me aright.’"
"Then We revealed to Moses, (saying), ‘Strike the sea with thy rod.’ Thereupon it parted, and every part (looked) like a huge mountain."
And We made others approach that place.
And We saved Moses and those who were with him.
Then We drowned the others.
"In this, verily, there is a Sign; but most of these would not believe."
"And surely thy Lord — He is the Mighty, the Merciful."
And recite unto them the story of Abraham.
"When he said to his father and his people, ‘What do you worship?’"
"They said, ‘We worship idols, and we continue to be devoted to them.’"
"He said, ‘Can they listen to you when you call (on them)?"
‘Or do you good or harm (you)?’
"They said, ‘Nay, but we found our fathers doing likewise.’"
"He said, ‘What think ye of that which you have been worshipping — "
‘You and your fathers before (you).
"‘They are (all) enemies to me, except the Lord of the worlds;"
"‘Who has created me, and it is He Who guides me;"
‘And Who gives me food and gives me drink;
"‘And when I am ill, it is He Who restores me to health;"
"‘And Who will cause me to die, and then bring me to life (again);"
"‘And Who, I hope, will forgive me my faults on the Day of Judgment."
"‘My Lord, bestow wisdom on me and join me with the righteous;"
‘And give me a true reputation among posterity;
‘And make me (one) of the inheritors of the Garden of Bliss;
‘And forgive my father; for he is (one) of the erring;
"‘And disgrace me not on the day when they will be raised up,"
‘The day when wealth and sons shall not avail;
‘But he (alone will be saved) who brings to Allah a sound heart;’
And Heaven shall be brought near to the righteous.
And Hell shall be opened to those who have gone astray.
"And it will be said to them, ‘Where is that which you worshipped"
‘Beside Allah? Can they help you or get help (for themselves)?’
"Then will they be thrown headlong therein, they and those who have gone astray,"
"And the hosts of Iblis, all together."
"They will say, whilst they dispute between themselves therein:"
"‘By Allah, we were in manifest error,"
‘When we held you as equal with the Lord of the worlds;
‘And none led us astray but the guilty ones.
"‘And now we have no intercessors,"
‘Nor any loving friend.
"‘Would that there were for us a return (to the world), that we might be among the believers!’"
"In this, verily, there is a Sign, but most of these would not believe."
"And verily thy Lord — He is the Mighty, the Merciful."
"The people of Noah treated the Messengers as liars,"
"When their brother Noah said to them, ‘Will you not be righteous?"
"‘Surely, I am unto you a Messenger, faithful to (my) trust."
"‘So fear Allah, and obey me."
‘And I ask of you no reward for it. My reward is only with the Lord of the worlds.
"‘So fear Allah, and obey me.’"
"They said, ‘Shall we believe thee, when it is the meanest that follow thee?’"
"He said, ‘And what knowledge have I as to what they have been doing?"
"‘Their account is only with my Lord, if you only knew!"
‘And I am not going to drive away the believers.
‘I am only a plain Warner.’
"They said, ‘If thou desist not, O Noah, thou shalt surely be one of those who are stoned.’"
"He said, ‘My Lord, my people have treated me as a liar."
‘Therefore judge Thou decisively between me and them; and save me and the believers that are with me.’
"So We saved him, and those who were with him in the fully laden Ark."
Then We drowned thereafter those who remained behind.
"In this, verily, there is a Sign, but most of them would not believe."
"And verily thy Lord — He is the Mighty, the Merciful."
" (The tribe of) ‘Ad rejected the Messengers,"
"When their brother Hud said to them, ‘Will you not be righteous?"
"‘Surely, I am unto you a Messenger, faithful to (my) trust."
"‘So fear Allah, and obey me."
‘And I ask of you no reward for it. My reward is only with the Lord of the worlds.
"‘Do you build monuments on every high place seeking vain glory,"
‘And do you erect palaces as though you will live forever?
"‘And when you lay hands (upon any one), you lay hands as tyrants."
"‘So fear Allah, and obey me."
‘And fear Him Who has helped you with all that you know.
"‘He has helped you with cattle, and sons,"
"‘And gardens, and springs."
"‘Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of an awful day.’"
"They said, ‘It is the same to us whether thou admonish (us) or whether thou be not of those who admonish.’"
"‘This is nothing but a habit of the ancients,"
‘And we shall not be punished.’
"So they rejected him, and We destroyed them. In that indeed there is a Sign, but most of these would not believe."
"And verily thy Lord — He is the Mighty, the Merciful."
" (The tribe of) Thamud rejected the Messengers,"
"When their brother Salih said to them, ‘Will you not be righteous?"
"‘Surely, I am unto you a Messenger, faithful to (my) trust."
"‘So fear Allah, and obey me."
‘And I ask of you no reward for it. My reward is only with the Lord of the worlds.
"‘Will you be left secure amid the things (that you have) here,"
"‘Amid gardens and springs,"
"‘And cornfields, and datepalms with (heavy) spathes near breaking?"
‘And you hew out houses in the mountains with great skill.
"‘So fear Allah, and obey me."
"‘And obey not the bidding of those who exceed the bounds,"
"‘Who create disorder in the earth, and reform (it) not.’"
"They said, ‘Thou art but (one) of the bewitched;"
"‘Thou art only a man like ourselves. So bring a Sign, if thou art (one) of the truthful.’"
"He said, ‘Here is a she-camel: she has (her) turn of drinking, and you have (your) turn of drinking on an appointed day."
‘And touch her not with evil lest there overtake you the punishment of an awful day.’
But they hamstrung her; and then they became regretful.
"So the punishment overtook them. In that verily there is a Sign, but most of these would not believe."
"And surely thy Lord — He is the Mighty, the Merciful."
"The people of Lot rejected the Messengers,"
"When their brother Lot said to them, ‘Will you not become righteous?"
"‘Surely, I am unto you a Messenger, faithful to (my) trust."
"‘So fear Allah, and obey me."
‘And I ask of you no reward for it. My reward is only with the Lord of the worlds.
"‘Do you, of all peoples, approach males,"
"‘And leave your wives whom your Lord has created for you? Nay, you are a people who transgress.’"
"They said, ‘If thou desist not, O Lot, thou wilt surely be (one) of the banished ones.’"
"He said, ‘Certainly I hate your practice."
"‘My Lord, save me and my family from what they do.’"
"So We saved him and his family, all (of them),"
Save an old woman among those who stayed behind.
Then We destroyed the others.
And We rained upon them a rain; and evil was the rain for those who were warned.
"In that verily there is a Sign, but most of these would not believe."
"And surely thy Lord — He is the Mighty, the Merciful."
"The People of the Wood rejected the Messengers,"
"When Shu‘aib said to them, ‘Will you not be righteous?"
"‘Surely, I am unto you a Messenger, faithful to (my) trust."
"‘So fear Allah, and obey me,"
‘And I ask of you no reward for it. My reward is only with the Lord of the worlds.
"‘Give full measure, and be not of those who give less,"
"‘And weigh with a true balance,"
"‘And diminish not unto people their things, nor act corruptly in the earth, making mischief."
‘And fear Him Who created you and the earlier peoples.’
"They said, ‘Thou art but (one) of the bewitched."
"‘And thou art only a man like ourselves, and we believe thee to be (one) of the liars."
"‘So cause fragments of the sky to fall on us, if thou art (one) of the truthful.’"
"He said, ‘My Lord knows best what you do.’"
So they declared him to be a liar. Then the punishment of the day of overshadowing gloom overtook them. That was indeed the punishment of a dreadful day.
"In that verily there is a Sign, but most of these would not believe."
"And surely thy Lord — He is the Mighty, the Merciful."
And verily this is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds.
"The Spirit, Faithful to the Trust, has descended with it."
"On thy heart, that thou mayest be of the Warners,"
In plain and clear Arabic tongue.
And it is surely (mentioned) in the Scriptures of the former peoples.
And is it not a Sign to them that the learned among the children of Israel know it?
"And if We had sent it down to one of the non-Arabs,"
"And he had read it to them, (even then) they would never have believed in it."
Thus have We caused it (disbelief) to enter into the hearts of the sinful.
They will not believe in it until they see the grievous punishment.
"But it will come upon them suddenly, while they know not,"
"And they will say, ‘Shall we be given any respite?’"
What! do they seek to hasten Our punishment?
What thinkest thou? If We let them enjoy (the good things of this world) for years;
Then there comes to them that with which they are threatened.
Of no avail shall be to them that which they were allowed to enjoy.
And never did We destroy any township but it had Warners.
 (This is) an admonition; and We are not unjust.
And the evil ones have not brought it down.
"They are not fit for it, nor have they the power (to do so)."
Surely they are debarred from hearing.
"Call not, therefore, on any other God beside Allah, lest thou become one of those who are punished."
"And warn thy nearest kinsmen,"
And lower thy wing (of mercy) to the believers who follow thee.
"Then if they disobey thee, say, ‘I repudiate all connection with what you do.’"
"And put thy trust in the Mighty, the Merciful,"
Who sees thee when thou standest up (in Prayer).
And (Who sees) thy movements among those who prostrate themselves (before God).
"He is indeed the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing."
Shall I inform you on whom the evil ones descend?
"They descend on every great liar (and) sinner,"
"Repeating what they hear, and most of them are liars."
And (as for) the poets — it is the erring ones who follow them.
"Dost thou not see how they wander distracted in every valley,"
And that they say what they practise not? — 
"Save those who believe and do good works, and remember Allah much, and retaliate (only) after they are wronged. And the wrongdoers will soon know to what place of return they shall return."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"Ta Sin. These are verses of the Qur’an, and of an illuminating Book,"
"A guidance and good tidings to those who would believe,"
"Who observe Prayer and pay the Zakat, and have firm faith in the Hereafter."
" (As to) those who believe not in the Hereafter, We have made their deeds (appear) beautiful to them, so they are wandering blindly."
"It is they who shall have a grievous torment, and they alone it is who shall be the greatest losers in the Hereafter."
"Verily, thou hast been given the Qur’an from the presence of One Wise, All-Knowing."
" (Remember) when Moses said to his family, ‘I perceive a fire. I will bring you from there some information, or I will bring you a flame, a (burning) brand, that you may warm yourselves.’"
"So when he came to it, he was called (by a voice): ‘Blessed is he who is in the fire and (also) those around it; and glorified be Allah, the Lord of the worlds."
"‘O Moses verily I am Allah, the Mighty, the Wise."
"‘And throw down thy rod.’ And when he saw it move as though it were a serpent, he turned back retreating and did not look back. ‘O Moses, fear not. Verily I am (with) (thee); the Messengers need have no fear in My presence."
"‘As to those who do wrong and then substitute good for evil; (to them), I am indeed Most Forgiving, Merciful."
‘And put thy hand into thy bosom; it will come forth white without any disease. (This is) among the nine Signs unto Pharaoh and his people; for they are a rebellious people.’
"But when Our sight giving Signs came to them, they said, ‘This is plain magic.’"
"And they rejected them wrongfully and arrogantly, while their souls were convinced of them. See then, how (evil) was the end of those who acted corruptly!"
"And We gave knowledge to David and Solomon, and they said, ‘All praise belongs to Allah, Who has exalted us above many of His believing servants.’"
"And Solomon was heir to David. And he said, ‘O ye people, we have been taught the language of birds; and we have had everything bestowed upon us. This indeed is (God)’(s) manifest grace.’"
"And there were gathered together unto Solomon his hosts of Jinn and men and birds, and they were formed into (separate) divisions,"
"Until when they came to the Valley of Al-Naml, one woman (of the tribe) of the Naml said, ‘O ye Naml, enter your habitations, lest Solomon and his hosts crush you,  while they know not.’"
"Thereupon he smiled, laughing at her words, and said, ‘My Lord, grant me (the will and power) to be grateful for Thy favour which Thou hast bestowed upon me and upon my parents, and to do (such) good works as would please Thee, and admit me, by Thy mercy, among Thy righteous servants.’"
"And he reviewed the birds, and said, ‘How is it that I do not see Hudhud? Is he among the absentees?"
"‘I will surely punish him with a severe punishment or I will slay him, unless he bring me a clear reason (for his absence).’"
"And he did not tarry long (before Hudhud came) and said, ‘I have encompassed that which thou hast not encompassed; and I have come to thee from Saba’ with sure tidings."
"‘I found a woman ruling over them, and she has been given everything, and she has a mighty throne."
"‘I found her and her people worshipping the sun instead of Allah; and Satan has made their works (look) beautiful to them, and has thus hindered them from the (right) way, so that they follow not guidance;"
"‘(And Satan has bidden them) not to worship Allah, Who brings to light that which is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and Who knows what you conceal and what you make known."
"‘Allah! there is no God but He, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.’"
" (Solomon) said, ‘We shall see whether thou hast spoken the truth or whether thou art one of those who lie."
"‘Go thou, with this letter of mine, and lay it before them; then withdraw from them and see what (answer) they return.’"
" (The Queen) said, “Ye chiefs, there has been delivered to me a noble letter."
"“It is from Solomon, and it is: ‘In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful;"
"‘Behave not proudly towards me, but come to me in submission.’”"
"She said, ‘Ye chiefs, advise me in the matter that is before me. I never decide any matter until you are present with me (and give me your advice).’"
"They replied, ‘We possess power and we possess great prowess in war, but it is for thee to command; therefore consider thou what thou wilt command.’"
"She said, ‘Surely, kings, when they enter a country, despoil it, and turn the highest of its people into the lowest. And thus will they do."
‘But I am going to send them a present and wait to see what (answer) the envoys bring back.’
"So when (the Queen)’(s ambassador) came to Solomon, he said, ‘Do you mean to help me with (your) wealth? But that which Allah has given me is better than that which He has given you. Nay, but you rejoice in your gift."
"‘Go back to them, for we shall surely come to them with hosts against which they will have no power, and we shall drive them out from there disgraced, and they will be humbled.’"
"He said, ‘O nobles, which of you will bring me a throne for her before they come to me, submitting?’"
Said a stalwart from among the Jinn: ‘I will bring it to thee before thou rise from thy camp; and indeed I possess power therefore (and I am) trustworthy.’
"Said one who had knowledge of the Book, ‘I will bring it to thee before thy noble (messengers) return to thee.’ And when he saw it set before him, he said, ‘This is by the grace of my Lord, that He may try me whether I am grateful or ungrateful. And whosoever is grateful is grateful for the good of his (own) soul; but whosoever is ungrateful, truly my Lord is Self- Sufficient, Generous.’"
"He said, ‘Make her throne unrecognizable to her, and let us see whether she follows the right way or whether she is (one) of those who follow not the right way.’"
"And when she came, it was said, ‘Is thy throne like this?’ She replied, ‘It is as though it were the same. And we had been given knowledge before this, and we have already submitted.’"
And that which she used to worship beside Allah had stopped her (from believing); for she came of a disbelieving people.
"It was said to her, ‘Enter the palace.’ And when she saw it, she thought it to be a great expanse of water, and she uncovered her shanks. (Solomon) said, ‘It is a palace paved smooth with slabs of glass.’ She said, ‘My Lord, I indeed wronged my soul; and I submit myself with Solomon to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.’"
"And We sent to Thamud their brother Salih, (who said), ‘Worship Allah.’ But behold, they became two parties contending with each other."
"He said, ‘O my people, why do you wish to hasten on the evil rather than the good? Wherefore do you not ask forgiveness of Allah that you may be shown mercy?’"
"They said, ‘We auger evil from thee and from those that are with thee.’ He said, ‘(The cause of) your evil fortune is with Allah. Nay, but you are a people who are on trial.’"
"And there were in the city a party of nine (persons) who made mischief in the land, and would not reform."
"They said, “Swear to each other by Allah that we will surely attack him and his family by night, and then we will say to his heir, ‘We witnessed not the destruction of his family, and most surely we are truthful.’”"
"And they planned a plan, and We planned a plan, but they perceived (it) not."
"Then see how (evil) was the end of their plan! Verily, We utterly destroyed them and their people all together."
"And yonder are their houses empty, because of their wrongdoing. In that, verily, is a Sign for a people who possess knowledge."
And We saved those who believed and feared God.
"And (remember) Lot, when he said to his people, ‘Do you commit abomination while you see (the evil thereof) ?"
"What! do you approach men lustfully rather than women? Nay, you are indeed an ignorant people.’"
"But the answer of his people was naught save that they said, ‘Drive out Lot’s family from your city. They are a people who would keep clean.’"
"So We saved him and his family, except his wife; her We decreed to be of those who stayed behind."
And We rained upon them a rain; and evil was the rain for those who were warned.
"Say, ‘All praise belongs to Allah, and peace be upon those servants of His whom He has chosen. Is Allah better or what they associate (with Him)?’"
"Or, Who created the heavens and the earth, and Who sent down water for you from the sky wherewith We cause to grow beautiful orchards? You could not cause their trees to grow. Is there a God besides Allah? Nay, they are a people who deviate (from the right path)."
"Or, Who made the earth a place of rest, and placed rivers in its midst, and placed upon it firm mountains, and put a barrier between the two waters? Is there a God besides Allah? Nay, most of them know not."
"Or, Who answers the distressed person when he calls upon Him, and removes the evil, and makes you successors in the earth? Is there a God besides Allah? Little is it that you reflect."
"Or, Who guides you in every (kind of) darkness of the land and of the sea, and Who sends the winds as glad tidings before His mercy? Is there a God besides Allah? Exalted is Allah above what they associate (with Him)."
"Or, Who originates creation, (and) then repeats it and Who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? Is there a God besides Allah? Say, ‘Bring forward your proof if you are truthful.’"
"Say, ‘None in the heavens and the earth knows the unseen save Allah; and they do not know when they will be raised up.’"
"Nay, their knowledge has reached its end respecting the Hereafter; nay, they are (indeed) in doubt about it; nay, they are blind to it."
"And those who disbelieve say, ‘What! when we and our fathers have become dust, shall we indeed be brought forth (again)?"
‘We were surely promised this before — we and our fathers; this is nothing but tales of the ancients.’
"Say, ‘Travel in the earth and see how (evil) was the end of the sinful!’"
"And grieve thou not for them, nor be thou in distress at what they plot."
"And they say, ‘When will this promise be (fulfilled), if you are truthful?’"
"Say, ‘It may be that a part of that which you would hasten on may be close behind you.’"
"And, truly, thy Lord is gracious to mankind, but most of them are not grateful."
"And, surely, thy Lord knows what their bosoms conceal and what they reveal."
"And there is nothing hidden in the heaven and the earth, but it is (recorded) in a clear Book."
"Verily, this Qur’an explains to the children of Israel most of that concerning which they differ."
"And verily, it is a guidance and a mercy to the believers."
"Verily, thy Lord will decide between them by His judgment, and He is the Mighty, the All-knowing."
"So put thy trust in Allah; surely, thou (standest) on manifest truth."
"Verily, thou canst not make the dead to hear, nor canst thou make the deaf to hear the call, when they turn back retreating."
"And thou canst not guide the blind out of their error. Thou canst make only those to hear who believe in Our Signs, for they submit."
"And when the sentence is passed against them, We shall bring forth for them a germ out of the earth, which shall wound them because people did not believe in Our Signs."
"And (remind them of) the day when We shall gather together from every people a party from among those who rejected Our Signs, and they shall be placed in (separate) bands."
"Till, when they come, He will say, ‘Did you reject My Signs, while you did not embrace them in your knowledge? Or what was it that you were doing?’"
"And the sentence shall fall upon them because they did wrong, and they will be speechless."
"Have they not seen that We have made the night that they may rest therein, and the day sight-giving? In that verily are Signs for a people who believe."
"And on the day when the trumpet will be blown, whoever is in the heavens and whoever is in the earth will be struck with terror, save him whom Allah pleases. And all shall come unto Him, humbled."
"And thou seest the mountains which thou thinkest to be firmly fixed, but they shall pass away like the passing of the clouds — the work of Allah Who has made everything perfect. Verily, He knows full well what you do."
"Whoever does a good deed, shall have a better reward than that, and such will be secure from terror that day."
"And those who do evil, shall be thrown down on their faces into the Fire: ‘Are you not rewarded for what you have been doing?’"
" (Say), ‘I am commanded only to serve the Lord of this city which He has made sacred, and to Him belong all things; and I am commanded to be of those who submit (to God);"
"‘And to recite the Qur’an.’ So whoever follows guidance, follows it only for (the good of) his own soul; and (as to him) who goes astray, say, ‘I am only a warner.’"
"And say, ‘All praise belongs to Allah; He will soon show you His Signs, and you will know them.’ And thy Lord is not unaware of what you do."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."

These are verses of the clear Book.
"We rehearse unto thee (a portion) of the story of Moses and Pharaoh with truth, for (the benefit of) a people who would believe."
"Verily, Pharaoh behaved arrogantly in the earth, and divided the people thereof into parties: he sought to weaken a party of them, slaying their sons, and sparing their women. Certainly, he was of the mischief- makers."
"And We desired to show favour unto those who had been considered weak in the earth, and to make them leaders and to make them inheritors (of Our favours),"
"And to establish them in the earth, and to show Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts that which they feared from them."
"And We revealed to the mother of Moses (saying), ‘Suckle him; and when thou fearest for him, then cast him into the river and fear not, nor grieve; for We shall restore him to thee, and shall make him (one) of the Messengers.’"
"And the family of Pharaoh picked him up that he might become for them an enemy and a (source of) sorrow. Verily, Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts were wrongdoers."
"And Pharaoh’s wife said, ‘(He will be) a joy of the eye, for me and for thee. Kill him not. Haply he will be useful to us, or we may adopt him as a son.’ And they perceived not (the consequences thereof)."
"And the heart of the mother of Moses became free (from anxiety). She had almost disclosed (his identity), were it not that We had strengthened her heart so that she might be of the (firm) believers."
"And she said to his sister, ‘Follow him up.’ So she observed him from afar; and they knew not (of her relationship)."
"And We had already ordained that he shall refuse the wet nurses; so she said, ‘Shall I tell you of a household who will bring him up for you and will be his sincere well-wishers?’"
"Thus did We restore him to his mother that her eye might be gladdened and that she might not grieve, and that she might know that the promise of Allah is true. But most of them know not."
"And when he reached his (age of) full strength and attained maturity, We gave him wisdom and knowledge; and thus do We reward those who do good."
"And he entered the city at a time when its inhabitants were in a state of heedlessness; and he found  therein two men fighting — one of his own party, and the other of his enemies. And he who was of his party sought his help against him who was of his enemies. So Moses smote him with his fist; and (thereby) caused his death. He said, ‘This is of Satan’s doing; he is indeed an enemy, a manifest misleader.’"
"He said, ‘My Lord, I have wronged my soul, therefore forgive me.’ So He forgave him; He is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"He said, ‘My Lord, because Thou hast bestowed favour upon me, I will never be a helper of the guilty.’"
"And morning found him in the city, apprehensive, watchful; and lo! he who had sought his help the day before cried out to him (again) for help. Moses said to him: ‘Verily, thou art manifestly a misguided fellow.’"
"And when he made up his mind to lay hold of the man who was an enemy to both of them, he said, ‘O Moses, dost thou intend to kill me as thou didst kill a man yesterday? Thou only intend est to become a tyrant in the land, and thou intendest not to be a peacemaker.’"
"And there came a man from the far side of the city, running. He said, ‘O Moses, of a truth, the chiefs are taking counsel together against thee to kill thee. Therefore get thee away; surely I am of thy well-wishers.’"
"So he went forth therefrom, fearing, watchful. He said, ‘My Lord, deliver me from the unjust people.’"
"And when he turned his face towards Midian, he said, ‘I hope my Lord will guide me to the right way.’"
"And when he arrived at the water of Midian, he found there a party of men, watering (their flocks). And he found beside them two women keeping back (their flocks). He said, ‘What is the matter with you?’ They replied, ‘We cannot water (our flocks) until the shepherds take away (their flocks), and our father is a very old man.’"
"So he watered (their flocks) for them. Then he turned aside into the shade, and said, ‘My Lord, I am in need of whatever good Thou mayest send down to me.’"
"And one of the two (women) came to him, walking bashfully. She said, ‘My father calls thee that he may reward thee for thy having watered (our flocks) for us.’ So when he came to him and told him the story, he said, ‘Fear not; thou hast escaped from the unjust people.’"
"One of the two (women) said, ‘O my father, hire him; for the best man that thou canst hire is the one who is strong and trustworthy.’"
"He said, ‘I intend to marry one of these two daughters of mine to thee on condition that thou serve me on hire for eight years. But if thou complete ten (years), it will be of thine own accord. And I would not lay any hardship upon thee; thou wilt find me, if Allah wills, of the righteous.’"
"He said, ‘That is (settled) between me and thee. Whichever of the two terms I fulfil, there shall be no injustice to me; and Allah watches over what we say.’"
"And when Moses had fulfilled the term, and journeyed with his family, he perceived a fire in the direction of the Mount. He said to his family, ‘Wait, I perceive a fire; haply I may bring you some (useful) information therefrom, or a burning brand from the fire that you may warm yourselves.’"
"And when he came to it, he was called (by a voice) from the right side of the Valley, in the blessed spot, out of the tree: ‘O Moses, verily I am, I am Allah, the Lord of the worlds.’"
"And (it also said): ‘Throw down thy rod.’ And when he saw it move as though it were a serpent, he turned back retreating and did not wait. ‘ O Moses, come forward and fear not; surely thou art of those who are safe."
"‘Insert thy hand into thy bosom; it will come forth white without evil (effect), and draw back thy arm toward thyself (to be free) from fear. So these (shall be) two proofs from thy Lord to Pharaoh and his chiefs. Surely they are a rebellious people.’"
"He said, ‘My Lord, I killed a person from among them, and I fear that they will kill me."
‘And my brother Aaron — he is more eloquent in speech than I; send him therefore with me as a helper that he may bear witness to my truth. I fear that they will accuse me of falsehood.’
" (God) said, ‘We will strengthen thy arm with thy brother and We will give power to you both so that they shall not be able to reach you. (Go) with Our Signs. You two and those  who follow you will be the winners.’"
"And when Moses came to them with Our clear Signs, they said, ‘This is nothing but sorcery devised, and we never heard (the like) of this among our forefathers.’"
"Moses said, ‘My Lord knows best who it is that has brought guidance from Him, and whose will be the reward of the (final) abode. Verily, the wrongdoers never prosper.’"
"And Pharaoh said, ‘O chiefs, I know of no God for you other than myself; so burn me (bricks of) clay, O Haman, and build me a tower, that I may have a look at the God of Moses, though I believe him to be one of the liars.’"
And he and his hosts behaved arrogantly in the land without any justification. And they thought that they would never be brought back to Us.
"So We seized him and his hosts, and cast them into the sea. See, then, how (evil) was the end of the wrongdoers!"
And We made them leaders inviting (people) unto the Fire; and on the Day of Resurrection they will receive no help.
And We caused them to be followed by a curse in this world; and on the Day of Resurrection they will be among those deprived of (all) good.
"And We gave the Book to Moses, after We had destroyed the earlier generations, as (a source of) enlightenment for men, and a guidance and a mercy, that they might reflect."
"And thou wast not on the western side (of the Mount) when We revealed the command to Moses, nor wast thou among the witnesses."
"But We brought forth generations (after Moses), and life became prolonged for them. And thou wast not a dweller among the people of Midian, rehearsing Our Signs unto them; but it is We Who sent Messengers."
"And thou wast not at the side of the Mount when We called. But (We have sent thee as) a mercy from thy Lord, that thou mayest warn a people to whom no Warner had come before thee, that they may reflect."
"And had it not been (for the fact) that, if an affliction should befall them because of what their hands have sent before (them), they would say, ‘Our Lord, wherefore didst Thou not send a Messenger to us that we might have followed Thy Signs, and been of the believers?’ (We should not have sent thee as a Messenger)."
"But when the truth came to them from Us, they said, ‘Why has he not  been given the like of what was given to Moses?’ Did they not reject that which was given to Moses before? They say, ‘Two (works) of sorcery — (the Torah and the Qur)’(an  —) that back up each other.’ And they say, ‘We disbelieve in all.’"
"Say, ‘Then bring a Book from Allah which is a better guide than (these) two, that I may follow it, if you are truthful.’"
"But if they answer thee not, then know that they only follow their own evil inclinations. And who is more erring than he who follows his evil inclinations without any guidance from Allah? Verily Allah guides not the unjust people."
"And We have, indeed, thoroughly conveyed to them the Word, that they may be admonished."
Those to whom We gave the Book before it — they believe in it;
"And when it is recited unto them, they say, ‘We believe in it. Verily, it is the truth from our Lord. Indeed, even before it we had submitted ourselves (to God).’"
"These will be given their reward twice, for they have been steadfast and they repel evil with good, and spend out of what We have given them."
"And when they hear vain talk, they turn away from it and say, ‘Unto us our works and unto you your works. Peace be to you. We seek not the ignorant.’"
Surely thou wilt not be able to guide (all) whom thou lovest; but Allah guides whomsoever He pleases; and He knows best those who would accept guidance.
"And they say, ‘If we were to follow the guidance with thee, we should be snatched away from our land.’ Have We not established for them a safe sanctuary, to which are brought the fruits of all things, (as) a provision from Us? But most of them know not."
And how many a habitation have We destroyed which exulted in its (manner of) life! And these are their dwellings which have not been inhabited after them except a little. And it is We Who became the Inheritors.
"And thy Lord would never destroy the towns until He has raised in the mother (town) thereof a Messenger, reciting unto them Our Signs; nor would We destroy the towns unless the people thereof are wrongdoers."
And whatever of the things (of this world) you are given is only a temporary enjoyment of the present life and an adornment thereof; and that which is with Allah is better and more lasting. Will you not then understand?
"Is he, then to whom We have promised a goodly promise (the fulfilment of) which he will meet, like the one whom We have provided with the good things of this life, and then on the Day of Resurrection he will be of those who will be brought (arraigned before God)?"
"And on that day He will call to them, and say, ‘Where are My ‘partners’ that you so imagined?’"
"Those against whom the sentence will become due, will say, ‘Our Lord, these are those whom we led astray. We led them astray, even as we had gone astray (ourselves). We (now) dissociate ourselves (from them and turn) to Thee. It was not us that they worshipped.’"
"And it will be said, ‘Call upon your partners.’ And they will call upon them, but they will not answer them. And they will see the punishment. Would that they had followed the guidance!"
"And on that day He will call to them and say, ‘What answer did you give to the Messengers?’"
"Then all excuses will become obscure to them on that day, and they shall not (even) ask each other."
"But as for him who repents and believes and does righteous deeds, maybe he will be among the prosperous."
"And thy Lord creates whatever He pleases and chooses (whomsoever He pleases). It is not for them to choose. Glorified be Allah, and far is He above all that they associate (with Him)."
"And thy Lord knows what their breasts conceal, and what they reveal."
And He is Allah; there is no God but He. To Him belongs all praise in the beginning and the Hereafter. His is the judgment and to Him shall you be brought back.
"Say, ‘Tell me, if Allah make the night continue over you till the Day of Resurrection, what God is there  besides Allah who could bring you light? Will you not then hearken?’"
"Say, ‘Tell me, if Allah make the day continue over you till the Day of Resurrection, what God is there besides Allah who could bring you a night wherein you could rest? Will you not then see?’"
"And of His mercy He has made for you the night and the day, that you may rest therein, and that you may seek of His bounty, and that you may be grateful."
"And on that day He will call to them and say, “Where are My ‘partners,’ whom you so imagined?”"
"And We shall draw from every people a witness and We shall say, ‘Bring your proof.’ Then they will know that the truth belongs to Allah. And that which they used to forge will be lost unto them."
"Verily, Korah was of the people of Moses, but he behaved arrogantly towards them. And We had given him of treasures so much that his hoardings would have weighed down a party of strong men. When his people said to him, ‘Exult not, surely Allah loves not those who exult."
"‘And seek, in that which Allah has given thee, the Home of the Hereafter; and neglect not thy lot in this world; and do good (to others) as  Allah has done good to thee; and seek not to make mischief in the earth, verily Allah loves not those who make mischief.’"
"He said, ‘This has been given to me because of the knowledge I possess.’ Did he not know that Allah had destroyed before him generations that were mightier than he and greater in riches? And the guilty shall not be asked (to offer an explanation) of their sins."
"So he went forth before his people in his pomp. Those who were desirous of the life of this world said, ‘O would that we had the like of what Korah has been given! Truly, he is the master of great fortune.’"
"But those who had been given knowledge said, ‘Woe to you, Allah’s reward is best for those who believe and do good works; and it shall be granted to none except those who are steadfast.’"
"Then We caused the earth to swallow him up and his dwelling; and he had no party to help him against Allah, nor was he of those who can defend themselves."
"And those who had coveted his position the day before began to say, ‘Ah! it is indeed Allah Who enlarges the provision for such of His servants as He pleases and straitens (it for whom He pleases). Had not Allah been gracious to us, He would have caused it to swallow us up (also.) Ah! the ungrateful never prosper.’"
"This is the Home of the Hereafter! We give it to those who desire not self-exaltation in the earth, nor corruption. And the end is  for the righteous."
He who does a good deed shall have better reward than that; and (as for him) who does an evil deed —  those who do evil deeds shall not be rewarded but (according to) what they did.
"Most surely He Who had made (the teaching of) Qur’an binding on thee will bring these back to (thy) place of return. Say, ‘My Lord knows best who brings the guidance, and who is in manifest error.’"
And thou didst never expect that the Book would be revealed to thee; but it is a mercy from thy Lord; so never be a helper of those who disbelieve.
"And let them not turn thee away from the Signs of Allah, after they have been sent down to thee; and call (mankind) to thy Lord, and be not of those who attribute partners (to Him)."
"And call not on any other God beside Allah. There is no God but He. Everything will perish except Himself. His is the judgement, and to Him will you be brought back."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
Alif Lam Mim.
"Do men think that they will be left alone because they say, ‘We believe,’ and that they will not be tested?"
And We did test those who were before them. So Allah will surely distinguish those who are truthful and He will surely distinguish the liars (from the truthful).
Or do those who commit evil deeds think that they will escape Us? Evil is what they judge.
"Whoso hopes to meet Allah, (let him be prepared for it), for Allah’s appointed time is certainly coming. And He is the All-Hearing, the All-knowing."
"And whoso strives, strives only for his own soul; verily Allah is Independent of all creatures."
"And (as to) those who believe and do good works, We shall surely remove from them their evils, and We shall surely give them the best reward of their works."
"And We have enjoined on man kindness to his parents; but if they strive to make thee associate that with Me of which thou hast no knowledge, then obey them not. Unto Me is your return, and I shall inform you of what you did."
And those who believe and do good works — them We shall surely admit into (the company of) the righteous.
"And of men there are (some) who say, ‘We believe in Allah,’ but when they are made to suffer in the cause of Allah, they regard the persecution of men to be like the punishment of Allah. And if help comes from thy Lord, they are sure to say, ‘Certainly, we were with you.’ Is not Allah best aware of what is in the bosom of (His) creatures?"
And Allah will surly distinguish those who believe and He will surely distinguish the hypocrites (from the believers).
"And those who disbelieve say to those who believe, ‘Follow our way, and we will surely bear your sins.’ And they cannot bear aught of their sins. They are surely liars."
"But they shall surely bear their own burdens, and (other) burdens along with their own burdens. And they will surely be questioned on the Day of Resurrection concerning that which they fabricated."
"And We certainly sent Noah to his people, and he dwelt among them a thousand years save fifty years. Then the deluge overtook them, while they were wrongdoers."
But We saved him and those who were (with him) in the Ark; and We made it a Sign for all peoples.
"And (remember) Abraham when he said to his people, ‘Worship Allah and fear Him. That is better  for you if you understand."
"‘You only worship idols beside Allah, and you forge a lie. Those whom you worship beside Allah have no power to provide sustenance for you. Then seek sustenance from Allah, and worship Him, and be grateful to Him. Unto Him will you be brought back."
"‘And if you reject, then generations before you (also) rejected. And the Messenger is only responsible for the clear conveying (of the Message)."
"See they not how Allah originates creation, then repeats it? That surely is easy for Allah."
"Say, ‘Travel in the earth, and see how He originated the creation. Then will Allah provide the latter creation.’ Surely, Allah has power over all things."
He punishes whom He pleases and shows mercy unto whom He pleases; and to Him will you be turned back.
And you cannot frustrate (the designs of Allah) in the earth nor in the heaven; nor have you any friend or helper beside Allah.
Those who disbelieve in the Signs of Allah and the meeting with Him — it is they who have despaired of My mercy. And they will have a grievous punishment.
"And the only answer of his people was that they said, ‘Slay him or burn him.’ But Allah saved him from the fire. In that surely are Signs for a people who (would) believe."
"And he said, ‘Verily you have taken for yourselves idols beside Allah, out of love for each other in the present life. Then on the Day of Resurrection you will deny each other, and curse each other. And your abode will be the Fire; and you will have no helpers.’"
"And Lot believed him; and (Abraham) said, ‘I take refuge with my Lord; surely He is the Mighty, the Wise.’"
"And We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob, and We placed (the gift of) prophethood and the Book among his descendants, and We gave him his reward in this life, and in the Hereafter he will surely be among the righteous."
"And (We sent) Lot; he said to his people, ‘You commit an abomination which none among mankind has ever committed before you."
"‘Do you indeed come (lustfully) to men and cut off the highway (for travellers)? And you commit abomination in your meetings!’ But the only answer of his people was that they said, ‘Bring upon us the punishment of Allah if thou speakest the truth.’"
"He said, ‘Help me, my Lord, against the wicked people.’"
"And when Our messengers brought Abraham the glad tidings, they said, ‘We are going to destroy the people of this town; surely its people are wrongdoers.’"
"He said, ‘But Lot is there.’ They said, ‘We know full well who is there. We will surely save him and his family, except his wife, who is of those who remain behind.’"
"And when Our messengers came to Lot, he was distressed on account of them and felt powerless with regard to them. And they said, ‘Fear not, nor grieve; we will surely save thee and thy family except thy wife, who is of those who remain behind."
"‘We are surely going to bring down on the people of this town a punishment from heaven, for they have been rebellious.’"
And We have left thereof a clear Sign for a people who would understand.
"And to Midian (We sent) their brother Shu‘aib who said, ‘O my people, serve Allah, and fear the Last Day and commit not iniquity in the earth, creating disorder.’"
"But they called him a liar. So a violent earthquake seized them, and in their homes they lay prostrate upon the ground."
"And (We destroyed) ‘Ad and Thamud; and it is evident to you from their dwelling-places. And Satan made their deeds (appear) good to them, and thus turned them away from the path, sagacious though they were."
"And (We destroyed) Korah and Pharaoh and Haman. And Moses did come to them with manifest Signs, but they behaved proudly in the earth, yet they could not outstrip (Us)."
"So each one (of them) We seized in his sin; of them were those against whom We sent a violent sandstorm, and of them were those whom a roaring blast overtook, and of them were those whom We caused the earth to swallow up, and of them were those whom We drowned. And Allah would not wrong them, but they used to wrong their own souls."
"The case of those who take helpers beside Allah is like unto the case of the spider, who makes for herself a house; and surely the frailest of (all) houses is the house of the spider, if they but knew!"
"Verily, Allah knows whatever they call upon beside Him; and He is the Mighty, the Wise."
"And these are similitudes which We set forth for mankind, but only those understand them who have knowledge."
Allah created the heavens and the earth in accordance with the requirements of wisdom. In that surely is a Sign for the believers.
"Recite that which has been revealed to thee of the Book, and observe Prayer. Surely, Prayer restrains (one) from indecency and manifest evil, and remembrance of Allah indeed is the greatest (virtue). And Allah knows what you do."
"And argue not with the People of the Book except with what is best; but (argue not at all) with such of them as are unjust. And say, ‘We believe in that which has been revealed to us and that which has been revealed to you; and our God and your God is one; and to Him we submit.’"
"And in like manner have We sent down the Book to thee, so those to whom We have given (true knowledge of) the Book believe in it (the Qur’an); and of these (Meccans also) there are some who believe in it. And none but the ungrateful deny Our Signs."
"And thou didst not recite any Book before it, nor didst thou write one with thy right hand; in that case the liars would have doubted."
"Nay, it is (a collection of) clear Signs in the hearts of those who are given knowledge. And none but the wrongdoers deny Our Signs."
"And they say, ‘Why are not Signs sent down to him from his Lord?’ Say, ‘The Signs are with Allah, and certainly I am a clear Warner.’"
"Is it not enough for them that We have sent down to thee the Book which is recited to them? Verily, there is mercy in it and a reminder for a people who believe."
"Say, ‘Allah is sufficient as a Witness between me and you. He knows what is in the heavens and the earth. And (as for) those who believe in falsehood and disbelieve in Allah, they it is who are the losers.’"
"They ask thee to hasten on the punishment; and had there not been an appointed term, the punishment would have come upon them. And it shall surely overtake them unexpectedly, while they perceive not."
"They ask thee to hasten on the punishment; but verily, Hell is (already) encompassing the disbelievers."
" (Remember) the day when the punishment will overwhelm them from above them and from underneath their feet, and He will say, ‘Taste ye (the fruit of) your actions.’"
"O My servants who believe! verily, vast is My earth, so worship Me alone."
Every soul shall taste of death; then to Us shall you be brought back.
"And those who believe and do good works — them shall We surely house in lofty mansions of Paradise, beneath which rivers flow. They will abide therein. Excellent is the reward of those who work (good),"
"Those who are steadfast, and put their trust in their Lord."
"And how many an animal there is that carries not its own sustenance! Allah provides for it and for you. And He is the All-Hearing, the All-knowing."
"And if thou ask them, ‘Who has created the heavens and the earth and pressed into service the sun and the moon?’, they will surely say, ‘Allah.’ How then are they being turned away (from the truth)?"
"Allah enlarges (the means of) sustenance for such of His servants as He pleases, and straitens (them) for whom (He pleases). Surely Allah has full knowledge of all things."
"And if thou ask them, ‘Who sends down water from the sky and therewith gives life to the earth after its death?’, they will surely say, ‘Allah.’ Say, ‘All praise belongs to Allah.’ But most of them understand not."
"And this life of the world is nothing but a pastime and a sport, and the Home of the Hereafter —  that indeed is Life, if they but knew!"
"And when they go on board a ship, they call on Allah, with sincere and exclusive faith in Him. But when He brings them safe to land, behold, they associate partners (with Him);"
"That they may deny that which We have bestowed on them, and that they may enjoy themselves (for a time). But they will soon come to know."
"Have they not seen that We have made the sanctuary secure (for them), while people are snatched away from all around them? Would they then believe in falsehood and deny the favour of Allah?"
"And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie concerning Allah, or rejects the truth when it comes to him? Is there not an abode in Hell for those who disbelieve?"
And (as for) those who strive in Our path — We will surely guide them in Our ways. And verily Allah is with those who do good.
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
Alif Lam Mim.
"The Romans have been defeated,"
"In the land nearby, and they, after their defeat, will be victorious."
"In a few years — Allah’s is the command before and after (that) —  and on that day the believers will rejoice,"
"With the help of Allah. He helps whom He pleases; and He is the Mighty, the Merciful."
"Allah (has made) this promise. Allah breaks not His promise, but most men know not."
"They know (only) the outer (aspect) of the life of this world, and of the Hereafter they are utterly unmindful."
Do they not reflect in their own minds? Allah has not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between the two but in accordance with the requirements of wisdom and for a fixed term. But many among men believe not in the meeting of their Lord.
"Have they not travelled in the earth so that they might see how (evil) was the end of those who were before them? They were stronger than these in power, and they tilled the soil and populated it more (and better) than these have populated it. And their Messengers came to them  with manifest Signs. And Allah would not wrong them, but they wronged their own souls."
"Then evil was the end of those who did evil, because they rejected the Signs of Allah, and mocked at them."
Allah originates creation; then He repeats it; then to Him shall you be brought back.
And on the day when the Hour will arrive the guilty shall be in despair.
And they shall have no intercessors from (among them) whom they associate (with God); and they will deny (those) whom they associate (with Him.)
And on the day when the Hour will arrive — on that day will they become separated (from one another).
Then those who believed and did good works will be honoured and made happy in a garden.
"But as for those who disbelieved and rejected Our Signs and the meeting of the Hereafter, these will be brought forth in punishment."
So glorify Allah when you enter the evening and when you enter the morning — 
And to Him belongs all praise in the heavens and the earth — and (glorify Him) in the afternoon and when you enter upon the time of the decline of the sun.
"He brings forth the living from the dead, and He brings forth the dead from the living; and He gives life to the earth after its death. And in like manner shall you be brought forth."
"And (one) of His Signs (is this), that He created you from dust; then, behold, you are men who move about (on the face of the earth)."
"And (one) of His Signs (is this), that He has created wives for you from among yourselves that you may find peace of mind in them, and He has put love and tenderness between you. In that surely are Signs for a people who reflect."
"And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the diversity of your tongues and colours. In that surely are Signs for those who possess knowledge."
"And among His Signs is your sleep by night and day, and your seeking of His bounty. In that surely are Signs for a people who hear."
"And (one) of His Signs (is this), that He shows you the lightning (as a source of) fear and hope, and He sends down water from the sky, and quickens therewith the earth after its death. In that surely are Signs for a people who understand."
"And among His Signs (is this), that the heaven and the earth stand (firm) by His command. Then when He calls you by a call (coming) from the earth, behold, you will come forth."
And to Him belongs whosoever is in the heavens and the earth. All are obedient to Him.
"And He it is Who originates the creation, then repeats it, and it is most easy for Him. His is the most exalted state in the heavens and the earth; and He is the Mighty, the Wise."
"He sets forth for you a parable concerning yourselves. Have you, among those whom your right hands possess, partners in what We have provided for you so that you become equal (sharers) therein (and) fear them as you fear each other? Thus do We explain the Signs to a people who understand."
"Nay, but those who are unjust follow their own low desires without any knowledge. Then who can guide him whom Allah has adjudged as lost? There will be no helpers for them."
So set thy face to (the service of) religion as one devoted (to God). (And follow) the nature made by Allah —  the nature in which He has created mankind. There is no altering the creation of Allah. That is the right religion. But most men know not.
" (Set your face to God), turning to Him (in repentance), and fear Him, and observe Prayer, and be not of those who associate partners (with God —) "
Of those who split up their religion and have become divided into sects; every party rejoicing in what they have.
"And when an affliction befalls men, they cry unto their Lord, turning to Him (in repentance); then, when He has made them taste of mercy from Him, lo! a section of them associate partners with their Lord,"
"So as to be ungrateful for what We have given them. So enjoy yourselves (awhile), but soon you will come to know."
Have We sent down to them any authority which speaks (in favour) of what they associate with Him?
"And when We make mankind taste of mercy, they rejoice therein; but if an evil befall them because of that which their own hands have sent on, behold! they are in despair."
"Have they not seen that Allah enlarges the provision to whomsoever He pleases, and straitens (it to whomsoever He pleases)? In that truly are Signs for a people who believe."
"So give to the kinsman his due, and to the needy, and to the wayfarer. That is best for those who seek the favour of Allah, and it is they who will prosper."
"Whatever you pay as interest that it may increase the wealth of the people, it does not increase in the sight of Allah; but whatever you give in Zakat seeking the favour of Allah — it is these who will increase (their wealth) manifold."
"It is Allah Who has created you, (and) then He has provided for you; then He will cause you to die, (and) then He will bring you to life. Is there any of your ‘partners’ who can do any of these things? Glorified be He and exalted above that which they associate (with Him.)"
"Corruption has appeared on land and sea because of what men’s hands have wrought, that He may make them taste (the fruit) of some of their doings, so that they may turn back (from evil)."
"Say, ‘Travel in the earth and see how (evil) was the end of those before (you)! Most of them were idolaters.’"
So set thy face to (the service of) the right religion before there comes the day from Allah for which there will be no averting. On that day (mankind) will split up (into parts).
"Those who disbelieve will bear (the consequences of) their disbelief; and those who do righteous deeds prepare (good) for themselves,"
"That He, out of His bounty, may reward those who believe and do righteous deeds. Surely, He loves not the disbelievers."
"And among His Signs (is this), that He sends the winds as bearers of glad tidings and that He may make you taste of His mercy, and that the ships may sail at His command, and that you may seek of His bounty, and that you may be grateful."
"And surely We sent Messengers before thee to their own people, and they brought them clear Signs. Then We punished those who were guilty. And it was certainly due from Us to help the believers."
" (It is) Allah Who sends the winds so that they raise a cloud. Then He spreads it in the sky as He pleases and places it layer upon layer and thou seest the rain issuing forth from its midst. And when He causes it to fall on whom He pleases of His servants, behold! they rejoice;"
Though before that — before it was sent down upon them — they were in despair.
"Look, therefore, at the marks of Allah’s mercy: how He quickens the earth after its death. Verily, the same (God) will quicken the dead; for He has power over all things."
"And if We sent a wind and they saw it (their harvest) turn yellow, they would certainly, thereafter, (begin to) deny (Our favours)."
"And thou canst not make the dead to hear, nor canst thou make the deaf to hear the call, when they turn away showing their backs."
Nor canst thou guide the blind out of their error. Thou canst make only those to hear who would believe in Our Signs and they submit.
" (It is) Allah Who created you in (a state of) weakness, and after weakness gave strength; then, after strength, caused weakness and old age. He creates what He pleases. He is the All-knowing, the All-Powerful."
And on the day when the Hour shall arrive the guilty will swear that they tarried not save an hour — thus were they turned away (from the right path).
"But those who are given knowledge and faith will say, ‘You have indeed tarried according to the Book of Allah, till the Day of Resurrection. And this is the Day of Resurrection, but you did not (care to) know.’"
So on that day their excuses will not avail the wrongdoers; nor will they be allowed to make amends.
"And truly, We have set forth for men in this Qur’an every kind of parable; and indeed, if thou bring  them a Sign, those who disbelieve will surely say, ‘You are but liars.’"
Thus does Allah seal the hearts of those who have no knowledge.
So be thou patient. Surely the promise of Allah is true; and let not those who have no certainty (of faith) make light of thee.
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."

"These are verses of the Book of Wisdom,"
"A guidance and a mercy for those who do good,"
Those who observe Prayer and pay the Zakat and who have firm faith in the Hereafter.
"It is they who follow guidance from their Lord, and it is they who shall prosper."
"And of men is he who takes idle tales in exchange (for guidance) to lead (men) astray from the path of Allah, without knowledge, and to make fun of it. For such there will be humiliating punishment."
"And when Our Signs are recited to him, he turns proudly away, as though he heard them not, as if there were a heaviness in both his ears. So announce to him a painful punishment."
"Surely those who believe and do good works — they will have Gardens of Delight,"
"Wherein they will abide. Allah has (made) a true promise; and He is the Mighty, the Wise."
"He has created the heavens without any pillars that you can see, and He has placed in the earth firm mountains that it may not quake with you, and He has scattered therein all kinds of creatures; and We have sent down water from the clouds, and caused to grow therein every noble species."
"This is the creation of Allah. Now show me what others beside Him have created. Nay, but the wrongdoers are in manifest error."
"And We bestowed wisdom on Luqman, (saying), ‘Be grateful to Allah:’ and whoso is grateful, is grateful only for (the good of) his own soul. And whoso is ungrateful, then surely Allah is Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy."
"And (remember) when Luqman said to his son while exhorting him, ‘O my dear son! associate not partners with Allah. Surely, associating partners (with God) is a grievous wrong.’"
"And We have enjoined on man concerning his parents — his mother bears him in weakness upon weakness, and his weaning takes two years — ‘Give thanks to Me and to thy parents. Unto Me is the (final) return."
"‘And if they contend with thee to make thee set up equals with Me concerning which thou hast no knowledge, obey them not, but be a kind companion to them in (all) worldly affairs; and (in spiritual matters) follow the way of him who turns to Me. Then unto Me will be your return and I shall inform you of what you used to do.’"
"‘O my dear son! even though it be the weight of a grain of mustard seed, and even though it be in a rock, or in the heavens, or in the earth, Allah will surely bring it out; verily Allah is the Knower of all subtleties, All-Aware."
"‘O my dear son! observe Prayer, and enjoin good, and forbid evil, and endure patiently whatever may befall thee. Surely this is of those matters (which require) firm resolve."
"‘And turn not thy cheek away from men in pride nor walk in the earth haughtily; Surely, Allah loves not any arrogant boaster."
"‘And walk thou at a moderate pace, and lower thy voice; verily, the most disagreeable of voices is the voice of the ass.’"
"Have you not seen that Allah has pressed for you into service whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and has completed His favours on you, (both) externally and internally? And among men there are some who dispute concerning Allah, without knowledge or guidance or an illuminating Book."
"And when it is said to them, ‘Follow that which Allah has revealed,’ they say, ‘Nay, we shall follow that which we found our fathers following.’ What! even though Satan was inviting them to the punishment of the burning fire?"
"And he who submits himself (completely) to Allah, and is a doer of good, he has surely grasped a strong handle. And with Allah (rests) the end of all affairs."
"And (as for) him who disbelieves, let not his disbelief grieve thee. Unto Us is their return and We shall tell them what they did; surely Allah knows full well what is in the breasts."
We shall let them enjoy themselves a little; then We shall drive them to a severe torment.
"And if thou ask them, ‘Who created the heavens and the earth?’, they will surely answer, ‘Allah.’ Say, ‘All praise belongs to Allah.’ But most of them know not."
"To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. Verily, Allah is Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy."
"And if all the trees that are in the earth were pens, and the ocean (were ink), with seven oceans swelling it thereafter, the words of Allah would not be exhausted. Surely, Allah is Mighty, Wise."
"Your creation and your resurrection are only like (the creation and resurrection of) a single soul. Verily Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing."
"Hast thou not seen that Allah makes the night pass into the day, and makes the day pass into the night, and He has pressed the sun and the moon into service; each pursuing its course till an appointed term, and that Allah is well aware of what you do?"
"That is because it is Allah alone Who is the True (God), and whatever they call upon beside Him is falsehood, and because it is Allah alone Who is the Most High, the Incomparably Great."
"Dost thou not see that the ships sail on the sea by the favour of Allah, that He may show you of His Signs? Therein surely are Signs for everyone who is patient (and) grateful."
"And when waves engulf them like (so many) coverings, they call upon Allah, being sincere to Him in faith; but when He brings them safe to land, then some of them take the right course. And none denies Our Signs save every perfidous (and) ungrateful person."
"O men, seek protection with your Lord and fear the day when the father will not be of any avail to his son, nor will the son at all be of any avail to his father. Allah’s promise is surely true. So let not worldly life beguile you, nor let the Deceiver deceive you concerning Allah."
"Verily, with Allah alone is the knowledge of the Hour. And He sends down the rain, and He knows what is in the wombs. And no soul knows what it will earn tomorrow, and no soul knows in what land it will die. Surely, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
Alif Lam Mim.
The revelation of the Book —  there is no doubt about it — is from the Lord of the worlds.
"Do they say, ‘He has forged it?’ Nay, it is the truth from thy Lord, that thou mayest warn a people to whom no Warner has come before thee, that haply they may follow guidance."
"Allah it is Who created the heavens and the earth, and that which is between them, in six periods; then He settled on the Throne. You have no helper or intercessor beside Him. Will you not then reflect?"
"He will plan the (Divine) Ordinance from the heaven unto the earth, then shall it go up to Him in a day the duration of which is a thousand years according to what you reckon."
"Such is the Knower of the unseen and the seen, the Mighty, the Merciful,"
Who has made perfect everything He has created. And He began the creation of man from clay.
Then He made his progeny from an extract of an insignificant fluid.
"Then He fashioned him and breathed into him of His spirit. And He has given you ears, and eyes, and  hearts. (But) little thanks do you give!"
"And they say, ‘What! when we are lost in the earth, shall we then become a new creation?’ Nay, but they are disbelievers in the meeting of their Lord."
"Say, ‘The angel of death that has been put in charge of you will cause you to die; then to your Lord will you be brought back.’"
"If only thou couldst see when the guilty will hang down their heads before their Lord, (and say), ‘Our Lord, we have seen and we have heard, so send us back that we may do good works; for (now) we are convinced.’"
"And if We had (enforced) Our will, We could have given every soul its guidance, but the word from Me has come true: ‘I will fill Hell with Jinn and men all together.’"
So taste ye (the punishment of your deeds) for you forgot the meeting of this day of yours. We (too) have forgotten you. And taste ye the lasting punishment because of that which you used to do.
"Only they believe in Our Signs who, when they are reminded of them, fall down prostrate and celebrate the praises of their Lord, and they are not proud."
"Their sides keep away from their beds; (and) they call on their Lord in fear and hope, and spend out of what We have bestowed on them."
"And no soul knows what joy of the eyes is kept hidden for them, as a reward for their good works."
"Is he, then, who is a believer like one who is disobedient? They are not equal."
"As for those who believe and do good works, they will have Gardens of Eternal Abode, as an entertainment, for what they used to do."
"And as for those who are disobedient, their abode will be the Fire. Every time they desire to come forth therefrom, they will be turned back into it, and it will be said to them, ‘Taste the punishment of the Fire which you used to deny,’"
"And most surely We will make them taste of the nearer punishment before the greater punishment, so that they may return (to Us with repentance)."
And who does greater wrong than he who is reminded of the Signs of his Lord and then turns away from them? We will surely punish the guilty.
And We did give Moses the Book — be not therefore in doubt as to the meeting with Him — and We made it a guidance for the children of Israel.
"And We made from among them leaders, who guided (the people) by Our command, whilst they themselves were steadfast and had firm faith in Our Signs."
"Verily, thy Lord — He will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that in which they disagree."
"Does it not guide them how many a generation We have destroyed before them, amid whose  dwellings they (now) walk about? In that surely are Signs. Will they not then hearken?"
"Have they not seen that We drive the water to the dry land and produce thereby crops of which their cattle eat, and they themselves? Will they not then see?"
"And they say, ‘When will this victory come, if you are truthful?’"
"Say, ‘On the day of victory the believing of the disbelievers will not avail them, nor will they be granted respite.’"
"So turn away from them, and wait. They are also waiting."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"O thou Prophet, seek protection in Allah, and follow not (the wishes of) the disbelievers and the hypocrites. Verily, Allah is All-Knowing, Wise."
And follow that which is revealed to thee from thy Lord. Verily Allah is well aware of what you do.
"And put thy trust in Allah, and Allah is sufficient as a Guardian."
"Allah has not made for any man two hearts in his breast; nor has He made those of your wives, from whom you keep away by calling them mothers, your (real) mothers, nor has He made your adopted sons your (real) sons. That is (merely) a word of your mouths; but Allah speaks the truth, and He guides to the (right) path."
"Call them by (the names of) their fathers. That is more equitable in the sight of Allah. But if you know not their fathers, then they are your brothers in faith and your friends. And there is no blame on you in any mistake you may unintentionally make in this (matter), but (what matters is) that which your hearts intend. And Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"The Prophet is nearer to the believers than their own selves, and his wives are (as) mothers to them. And blood relations are nearer to one another, according to the Book of Allah, than (the rest of) the believers (from among the Helpers) as well as the Emigrants, except that you show kindness to your friends. That (also) is written down in the Book."
"And (remember) when We took from the Prophets their covenant, and from thee, and from Noah, and Abraham, and Moses, and Jesus, son of Mary, and We (indeed) took from them a solemn covenant;"
That He may question the truthful about their truthfulness. And for the disbelievers He has prepared a painful punishment.
"O ye who believe! remember the favour of Allah on you when there came down upon you hosts, and We sent against them a wind and hosts that you saw not. And Allah sees what you do."
"When they came upon you from above you, and from below you, and when (your) eyes became distracted, and (your) hearts reached to the throats, and you thought (diverse) thoughts about Allah."
"There (and then) were the believers (sorely) tried, and they were shaken with a violent shaking."
"And when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts was a disease said, ‘Allah and His Messenger promised us nothing but a delusion.’"
"And when a party of them said, ‘O people of Yathrib‡, you have (possibly) no stand (against the enemy), therefore turn back.’ And a section of them (even) asked leave of the Prophet, saying, ‘Our houses are exposed (and defenceless).’ And they were (in truth) not exposed. They only sought to flee away."
"And if entry were effected against them (into the town) from its environs, and then they were asked (to join in) the disturbances, they would have (at once) done so, and would not have tarried in their houses save a little."
And truly they had already covenanted with Allah (that) they would not turn their backs. And a covenant with Allah will have to be answered for.
"Say, ‘Flight shall not avail you if you flee from death or slaughter; and (even) then you will enjoy but a little.’"
"Say, ‘Who is it that can save you against Allah if it be His wish to do you harm or if it be His wish to show you mercy?’ And they will not find for themselves any friend or helper other than Allah."
"Verily Allah knows those among you who hinder (men) and those who say to their brethren, ‘Come to us;’ and they come not to the fight but a little,"
"Being niggardly with regard to you. But when danger comes, thou seest them looking towards thee, their eyes rolling like one who is fainting on account of death. But when the fear has passed away, they assail you with sharp tongues being  greedy for wealth. These have never believed; so Allah has rendered their works null and void. And that is an easy thing for Allah."
"They think that the confederates have not gone away; and if the confederates should come (again), they would wish to be among the nomad Arabs in the desert, asking for news about you. And if they were among you they would not fight save a little."
"Verily you have in the Prophet of Allah an excellent model, for him who fears Allah and the Last Day and who remembers Allah much."
"And when the believers saw the confederates, they said, ‘This is what Allah and His Messenger promised us; and Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth.’ And it only added to their faith and submission."
"Among the believers are men who have been true to the covenant they made with Allah. There are (some) of them who have fulfilled their vow, and (some) who (still) wait, and they have not changed (their condition) in the least;"
"That Allah may reward the truthful for their truth, and punish the hypocrites if He so please, or turn to them in mercy. Verily Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"And Allah turned back the disbelievers in their rage; they gained no good. And Allah sufficed the believes in their fight. And Allah is Powerful, Mighty."
"And He brought those of the People of the Book who aided them down from their fortresses and cast terror into their hearts. Some you slew, and some you took captive."
"And He made you inherit their land and their houses and their wealth, and a land on which you had never set foot. And Allah has power over all things."
"O Prophet! say to thy wives, ‘If you desire the life of this world and its adornment, come then, I will provide for you and send you away in a handsome manner."
"‘But if you desire Allah and His Messenger and the Home of the Hereafter, then truly Allah has prepared for those of you who do good a great reward.’"
"O wives of the Prophet! if any of you be guilty of manifestly dishonourable conduct, the punishment will be doubled for her. And that is easy for Allah."
"But whoever of you is obedient to Allah and His Messenger and does good works, We shall give her her reward twice over; and We have prepared for her an honourable provision."
"O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any (other) women if you are righteous. So be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease should feel tempted; and speak a decent speech."
"And stay in your houses (with dignity), and do not show off yourselves like the showing off of the former days of ignorance, and observe Prayer, and pay the Zakat, and obey Allah and His Messenger. Surely Allah desires to remove from you (all) uncleanness, O Members of the Household, and purify you completely."
"And remember what is rehearsed in your houses of the Signs of Allah and of wisdom. Verily Allah is the Knower of subtleties, All-Aware."
"Surely, men who submit themselves (to God) and women who submit themselves (to Him), and believing men and believing women, and obedient men and obedient women and truthful men and truthful women, and men steadfast (in their faith) and steadfast women, and men who are humble and women who are humble, and men who give alms and women who give alms, and men who fast and women who fast, and men who guard their chastity and women who guard (their chastity), and men who remember Allah much and women who remember (Him) — Allah has prepared for (all of) them forgiveness and a great reward."
"And it behoves not a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter, that there should be a choice for them in the matter concerning them. And whoso disobeys Allah and His Messenger, surely strays away in manifest error."
"And (remember) when thou didst say to him on whom Allah had bestowed favours and on whom thou (also) hadst bestowed favours: ‘Keep thy wife to thyself, and fear Allah.’  And thou didst conceal in thy heart what Allah was going to bring to light, and thou wast afraid of the people, whereas Allah has better right that thou shouldst fear Him. Then, when Zaid had accomplished his want of her (so as to have no further need of her), We joined her in marriage to thee, so that there may be no hindrance for the believers with regard to the wives of their adopted sons, when they have accomplished their want of them. And Allah’s decree must be fulfilled."
There can be no hindrance for the Prophet with regard to that which Allah has made incumbent upon him. Such indeed was the way of Allah with those who have passed away before — and the command of Allah is a decree ordained — 
"Those who delivered the Messages of Allah and feared Him, and feared none but Allah. And sufficient is Allah as a Reckoner."
"Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but (he is) the Messenger of Allah and the Seal of the Prophets; and Allah has full knowledge of all things."
O ye who believe! remember Allah with much remembrance;
And glorify Him morning and evening.
"He it is Who sends blessings on you, as (do) His angels, that He may bring you forth from all (kinds of) darkness into light. And He is Merciful to the believers."
"Their greeting on the day when they meet Him will be, ‘Peace.’ And He has prepared for them an honourable reward."
"O Prophet, truly We have sent thee as a Witness, and Bearer of glad tidings, and a Warner,"
"And as a Summoner unto Allah by His command, and as a Lamp that gives (bright) light."
And announce to the believers the glad tidings that they will have great bounty from Allah.
"And follow not the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and leave alone their annoyance, and put thy trust in Allah; for Allah is sufficient as a Guardian."
"O ye who believe! when you marry believing women and then divorce them before you have touched them, then you have no right against them with regard to the period of waiting that you reckon. So make some provision for them and send them away in a handsome manner."
"O Prophet, We have made lawful to thee thy wives whom thou hast paid their dowries, and those whom thy right hand possesses from among those whom Allah has given thee as gains of war, and the daughters of thy paternal uncle, and the daughters of thy paternal aunts, and the daughters of thy maternal uncle, and the daughters of thy maternal aunts who have emigrated with thee, and any (other) believing woman if she offers herself (for marriage) to the Prophet provided the Prophet desires to marry her; (this is) only for thee, as against (other) believers — We have already made known what We have enjoined  on them concerning their wives and those whom their right hands possess —  in order that there may be no difficulty for thee (in the discharge of thy work). And Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"Thou mayest defer (the marriage of) any of them that thou pleasest, and receive unto thyself whom thou pleasest; and if thou desirest (to take back) any of those whom thou hast put aside, there is no blame on thee. That is more likely that their eyes may be cooled, and that they may not grieve, and that they may all be pleased with that which thou hast given them. And Allah knows what is in your hearts; and Allah is All-Knowing, Forbearing."
"It is not allowed to thee (to marry) women after that, not to change them for (other) wives even though their goodness please thee, except any that thy right hand possesses. And Allah is Watchful over all things."
"O ye who believe! enter not the houses of the Prophet unless leave is granted to you for a meal without waiting for its (appointed) time. But enter when you are invited, and when you have finished eating, disperse, without seeking to engage in talk. That causes inconvenience to the Prophet, and he feels shy of (asking) you (to leave.) But Allah is not shy of (saying) what is true. And when you ask them (the wives of the Prophet) for anything, ask them from behind a curtain. That is purer for your hearts and their hearts. And it behoves you not to cause inconvenience  to the Messenger of Allah, nor that you should ever marry his wives after him. Indeed that would be an enormity in the sight of Allah."
"Whether you reveal a thing or conceal it, Allah knows all things full well."
"There is no blame on them (in this respect) with regard to their fathers or their sons or their brothers or the sons of their brothers or the sons of their sisters or their womenfolk or those whom their right hands possess. And fear Allah, (O wives of the Prophet), verily, Allah is Witness over all things."
Allah and His angels send blessings on the Prophet. O ye who believe! you (also) should invoke blessings on him and salute (him) with the salutation of peace.
"Verily, those who malign Allah and His Messenger — Allah has cursed them in this world and in the Hereafter, and has prepared for them an abasing punishment."
And those who malign believing men and believing women for what they have not earned shall bear (the guilt of) a calumny and a manifest sin.
"O Prophet! tell thy wives and thy daughters and the women of the believers that they should draw close to them portions of their (loose) outer coverings. That is nearer that they may (thus) be distinguished and not molested. And Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"If the hypocrites, and those in whose heart is a disease, and those who cause agitation in the city, desist not, We shall surely give thee authority over them; then they will not dwell therein as thy neighbours, save for a little while."
" (Then they will be) accursed. Wherever they are found, they will be seized, and cut into pieces."
"Such has been the way of Allah in (the case of) those who passed away before, and thou wilt never find a change in the way of Allah."
"Men ask thee concerning the Hour. Say, ‘The knowledge of it is with Allah (alone).’ And what will make thee know that the Hour may be nigh?"
"Allah has surely cursed the disbelievers, and has prepared for them a burning fire,"
Wherein they will abide for ever. They will find (therein) no friend nor helper.
"On the day when their faces are turned over in the Fire, they will say, ‘Oh, would that we had obeyed Allah and obeyed the Messenger!’"
"And they will say, ‘Our Lord, we obeyed our chiefs and our great ones and they led us astray from the way."
"‘Our Lord, give them double punishment and curse them with a very great curse.’"
O ye who believe! be not like those who vexed and slandered Moses; but Allah cleared him of  what they spoke (of him). And he was honourable in the sight of Allah.
"O ye who believe! fear Allah, and say the right word."
"He will bless your works for you and forgive you your sins. And whoso obeys Allah and His Messenger, shall surely attain a mighty success."
"Verily, We offered the Trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, but they refused to bear it and were afraid of it. But man bore it. Indeed, he is (capable of being) unjust (to), (and) neglectful (of), (himself)."
" (The result is) that Allah will punish hypocritical men and hypocritical women, and idolatrous men and idolatrous women; and Allah turns in mercy to believing men and believing women; and Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"All praise is due to Allah, to Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. And His is all praise in the Hereafter; and He is the Wise, the All-Aware."
"He knows whatever goes into the earth and whatever comes forth from it, and whatever descends from the heaven and whatever ascends into it; and He is Merciful, Most Forgiving."
"And those who disbelieve say, ‘The Hour will never come upon us.’ Say, ‘Yea, by my Lord Who knows the unseen, it will surely come upon you! Not an atom’s weight in the heavens or in the earth or any thing less than that or greater escapes Him, but (all is recorded) in a perspicuous Book,"
‘That He may reward those who believe and do good works. It is these who will have forgiveness and an honourable provision.’
"But (as to) those who strive against Our Signs, seeking to frustrate (Our plans), it is they for whom there will be the suffering of a painful punishment."
"And those who are given knowledge see that whatever has been revealed to thee from thy Lord is the truth, and guides unto the path of the Mighty, the Praiseworthy."
"And those who disbelieve say, ‘Shall we show you a man who will tell you (that) when you are broken up into pieces, you shall be (raised as) a new creation?"
"‘Has he forged a lie against Allah or is he afflicted with madness?’ Nay, but it is those who believe not in the Hereafter that are suffering from the punishment and are too far gone in error."
"Do they not see what is before them and what is behind them of the heaven and the earth? If We please, We could cause the earth to sink with them, or cause pieces of the sky to fall upon them. In that verily is a Sign for every repentant servant."
"And certainly, We bestowed grace upon David from (Ourselves): ‘O ye mountains, repeat (the praises of All)a(h) with him, and O birds, (ye also).’ And We made the iron soft for him,"
" (Saying), ‘Make thou full-length coats of mail, and make the rings of a proper measure. And do righteous deeds, surely I see all that you do.’"
"And to Solomon (We subjected) the wind; its morning course was a month’s (journey), and its evening course was a month’s (journey too). And We caused a fount of molten copper to flow for him. And of the Jinn were (some) who worked under him, by the command of his Lord. And (We had told them that) if any of them turned away from Our command, We would make him taste the punishment of burning fire."
"They made for him what he desired; palaces and statues, and basins like reservoirs, and large cooking vessels fixed in their places: ‘Work ye, O House of David  gratefully;’ but few of My servants are grateful."
"And when We decreed his (Solomon’s) death, nothing pointed out to them that he was dead save a worm of the earth that ate away his staff. So when he fell down, the Jinn plainly realized that if they had known the unseen, they would not have remained in a state of degrading torment."
There was indeed a Sign for Saba’ in their home-land: two gardens on the right hand and on the left: ‘Eat of the provision of your Lord and be grateful to Him. A good land and a Most Forgiving Lord!’
"But they turned away; so We sent against them a fierce flood. And We gave them, in lieu of their gardens, two gardens bearing bitter fruit and tamarisk and a few lotetrees."
That We awarded them because of their ingratitude; and none do We requite (in this way) but the ungrateful.
"And We placed, between them and the towns which We had blessed, (other) towns that were prominently visible, and We fixed easy stages between them; ‘Travel in them for nights and days in security.’"
"But they said, ‘Our Lord, place longer distances between (the stages of) our journeys.’ And they wronged  themselves; so We made them bywords and We broke them into pieces, a complete breaking up. In that verily are Signs for every steadfast and grateful person."
"And Iblis found that his judgment of them was true, so they followed him, (all) except a party of (true) believers."
"And he had no power over them, but (it was so) that We might distinguish those who believed in the Hereafter from those who were in doubt about it. And thy Lord is Watchful over all things."
"Say, ‘Call upon those whom you assert (to be gods) beside Allah. They control not (even) the weight of an atom in the heavens or in the earth, nor have they any share in either, nor has He any helper among them.’"
"No intercession avails with Him, except for him about whom He permits (it), until when their hearts are relieved of fright they would say, ‘What is it that your Lord said?’ They (the Messengers) will answer, ‘The truth.’ And He is the High, the Great."
"Say, ‘Who gives you sustenance from the heavens and the earth?’ Say, ‘Allah. Either we or you are on right guidance or in manifest error.’"
"Say, ‘You will not be questioned as to our sins, nor shall we be questioned as to what you do.’"
"Say, ‘Our Lord will bring us all together; then He will judge between us with truth: and He is the Judge, the All-Knowing.’"
"Say, ‘Show me those whom you have joined with Him as partners. Nay! (You cannot do so), for He is Allah, the Mighty, the Wise.’"
"And We have not sent thee but as a bearer of glad tidings and a Warner, for all mankind, but most men know not."
"And they say, ‘When will this promise (be fulfilled), if you are truthful?’"
"Say, ‘For you is the promise of a day from which you cannot remain behind a single moment nor can you get ahead (of it).’"
"And those who disbelieve say, ‘We will never believe in this Qur’an, nor in what is before it;’ and couldst thou see when the wrongdoers will be made to stand before their Lord, throwing back on one another the blame. Those who were considered weak will say to those who were proud, ‘Had it not been for you, we should surely have been believers.’"
"Those who were proud will say to those who were considered weak, ‘Was it we that kept you away from the guidance, after it had come to you? Nay, it was you yourselves who were guilty.’"
"And those who were considered weak will say to those who were proud, ‘Nay, but it was (your) scheming night and day, when you bade us disbelieve in Allah and set up equals unto Him.’ And they will conceal (their) remorse when they see the punishment; and We shall put chains round the necks of those who disbelieved. They will not be requited but for what they did."
"And We never sent a Warner to any city but the wealthy ones thereof said, ‘Surely, we disbelieve  in what you have been sent with.’"
"And they say, ‘We have more riches and children; and we are not going to be punished.’"
"Say, ‘Verily, my Lord enlarges the provision for whomsoever He pleases, and straitens (it for whomsoever He pleases); but most men do not know.’"
"And it is not your riches nor your children that will bring you near Us in rank, but those who believe and do good works, will have a double reward for what they did. And in lofty mansions will they be secure."
"And (as to) those who strive to frustrate (the purpose of) Our Signs, it is they who will be brought face to face with punishment."
"Say, ‘Surely, my Lord enlarges the provision for such of His servants as He pleases and straitens (it) for such of them as (He pleases). And whatever you spend, He will replace it; and He is the Best of providers.’"
"And (remember) the day, when He will gather them all together; then He will say to the angels: ‘Was it you that they worshipped?’"
"They will say, ‘Holy art Thou. Thou art our Protector against them. Nay, but they worshipped the Jinn; it was in them that most of them believed.’"
"‘So, this day, you will have no power either to profit or harm one another.’ And We shall say to those  who did wrong: ‘Taste ye the punishment of the Fire that you denied.’"
"And when Our manifest Signs are recited to them, they say, ‘This is but a man who seeks to turn you away from that which your fathers worshipped.’ And they say, ‘This is but a forged lie.’ And those who disbelieve say about the truth when it comes to them, ‘This is nothing but clear magic.’"
"And We gave them no books which they studied, nor did We send to them any Warner before thee."
"And those who were before them (also) rejected (the truth —) and these have not attained (even) to a tenth of that which We gave them, but they treated My Messengers as liars. So how (terrible) was the change I (brought about)!"
"Say, ‘I only exhort you (to do) one thing: that you stand up before Allah in twos and singly and then reflect. (You will then know that) there is no insanity in your companion; he is only a Warner to you of an impending severe punishment.’"
"Say, ‘Whatever reward I might have asked of you — let it be yours. My reward is only with Allah; and He is Witness over all things.’"
"Say, ‘Truly, my Lord hurls the Truth (at falsehood). (He is) the Great Knower of the unseen.’"
"Say, ‘The Truth has come, and falsehood could neither originate (any good) nor reproduce (it).’"
"Say, ‘ If I err, I err only against myself; and if I am rightly guided, it is because of what my Lord has revealed to me. Verily, He is All-Hearing, Nigh.’"
"Couldst thou but see when they will be smitten with fear! Then there will be no escape, and they will be seized from a place nearby."
"And they will say, ‘We (now) believe therein.’ But how can the attaining (of faith) be possible to them from a position (so) far-off,"
While they had disbelieved in it before? And they are uttering conjectures from a far-off place.
"And a barrier will be placed between them and that which they long for, as was done with the likes of them before. They (too) were in disquieting doubt indeed."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"All praise belongs to Allah, the Maker of the heavens and the earth, Who employs the angels as messengers, having wings, two, three, and four. He adds to (His) creation whatever He pleases; for Allah has power over all things."
"Whatever of mercy Allah grants to men — there is none to withhold it; and whatever He withholds, there is none who can release it after that; and He is the Mighty, the Wise."
"O ye men, remember the favour of Allah towards you. Is there any Creator other than Allah (Who) provides for you from the heaven and earth? There is none worthy of worship but He. Whither then are you turned away?"
"And if they reject thee, verily, (God’s) Messengers have been rejected before thee; and unto Allah (all) things are brought back (for decision)."
"O ye men, assuredly the promise of Allah is true, so let not the present life deceive you, nor let the Deceiver deceive you with respect to Allah."
Surely Satan is an enemy to you; so take him as an enemy. He calls his followers only that they may become inmates of the burning Fire.
For those who disbelieve there is a severe punishment. And for those who believe and do good works there is forgiveness and a great reward.
"Is he , then, to whom the evil of his deed is made (to appear) pleasing, so that he looks upon it as good, (like him who believes and does good deeds)? Surely, Allah adjudges astray whom He will and guides whom He will. So let not thy soul waste away in sighing for them. Surely Allah knows what they do."
"And Allah it is Who sends the winds which raise the clouds; then do We drive them to a lifeless tract of land, and quicken thereby the earth after its death. Likewise (shall) the Resurrection (be)."
"Whoso desires honour, then (let him know that) all honour belongs to Allah. Unto Him ascend good words, and righteous work does He exalt. And those who plot evils — for them is a severe punishment; and the plotting of such will perish."
"And Allah created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then He made you pairs. And no female conceives, nor does she bring forth (a child) without His knowledge. And no one whose life is prolonged has (his) life prolonged, nor is anything diminished of his life, but (it is recorded) in a Book. That surely is easy for Allah."
"And the two seas are not alike: this one palatable, sweet (and) pleasant to drink, and the other, salt (and) bitter. And from each you eat fresh meat, and take forth ornaments which you wear. And thou seest the ships therein ploughing (the waves) that you may seek of His bounty, and that you  may be grateful."
"He merges the night into the day, and He merges the day into the night. And He has pressed into service the sun and the moon; each one runs (its) course to an appointed term. Such is Allah, your Lord; His is the kingdom, and those whom you call upon beside Allah own not even a whit."
"If you call on them, they will not hear your call; and even if they heard it, they could not answer you. And on the Day of Resurrection they will deny your having associated (them with God). And none can inform thee like the (One Who is) All-Aware."
"O ye men, it is you that stand in need of Allah, but Allah is He Who is Self-Sufficent, the Praiseworthy."
"If He please, He could destroy you, and bring a new creation (instead)."
And that is not difficult for Allah.
"And no burdened (soul) can bear the burden of another; and if a heavily laden (soul) call another to (bear) its load, naught of it shall be carried (by the other), even though he be a kinsman. Thou canst warn only those who fear their Lord in secret and observe Prayer. And whoso purifies himself, purifies himself only to his own advantage; and to Allah shall be the return."
"And the blind and the seeing are not alike,"
"Nor the darkness and light,"
Nor the shade and heat.
"Nor alike are the living and the dead. Surely, Allah causes him to hear whom He pleases; and thou canst not make those to hear who are in the graves."
Thou art only a Warner.
"Verily, We have sent thee with the truth, (as) a bearer of glad tidings and (as) a Warner; and there is no people to whom a Warner has not been sent."
"And if they treat thee as a liar, those who were before them (also) treated (their Prophets) as liars. Their Messengers came to them with clear Signs, and with the Scriptures, and with the illuminating Book."
Then I seized those who disbelieved and how (terrible) was the change I (brought about)!
"Dost thou not see that Allah sends down water from the sky and We bring forth therewith fruits of different colours; and among the mountains are streaks white and red, of diverse hues and others raven black;"
"And of men and beasts and cattle, in like manner, there are various colours? Only those of His servants who possess knowledge fear Allah. Verily, Allah is Mighty, Most Forgiving."
"Surely, (only) those who follow the Book of Allah and observe Prayer and spend out of what We have provided for them, secretly and openly, hope for a bargain which will never fail;"
"In order that He may give them their full rewards, and (even) increase them out of His bounty. He is surely Most Forgiving, Most Appreciating."
"And the Book which We have revealed to thee is the truth (itself), fulfilling that which is before it. Surely, Allah is All-Aware, All-Seeing with respect to His servants."
"Then We gave the Book for an inheritance to those of Our servants whom We chose. And of them are (some) who are breaking down their own selves (by suppressing their desires), and of them are (some) who keep to the right course, and of them are (some) who excel (others) in acts of goodness by Allah’s leave. And that (indeed) is the great distinction."
"Gardens of Eternity! They will enter them. They will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold, and pearls; and their garments therein will be of silk."
"And they will say, ‘All praise belongs to Allah Who has removed grief from us. Surely, our Lord is Most Forgiving, Most Appreciating,"
"‘Who has, out of His bounty, settled us in the Adobe of Eternity, where no toil will touch us, nor any (sense of) weariness affect us therein.’"
"But (as for) those who disbelieve, for them is the fire of Hell. Death will not be decreed for them so that they may die; nor will the punishment thereof be lightened for them. Thus do We requite every ungrateful person."
"And they will cry for help therein, ‘O our Lord, take us out, we will do righteous works other than those we used to do.’ ‘Did We not give you a life (long enough) so that he who would reflect could reflect  therein? And there came unto you a Warner (too). So taste ye (the punishment); for wrongdoers have no helper.’"
"Verily, Allah knows the secrets of the heavens and of the earth. Verily, He knows full well all (that lies hidden) in the breasts."
"He it is Who made you vicegerents in the earth. So he who disbelieves, will (himself) suffer (the consequences of) his disbelief. And for the disbelievers their disbelief will only increase odium in the sight of their Lord, and their disbelief will increase for the disbelievers nothing but loss."
"Say, ‘Have you seen your associate- gods whom you call on beside Allah? Show me (then) what they have created of the earth. Or have they a share in the creation of the heavens? Or have We given them a Book so that they have an evidence therefrom?’ Nay, the wrongdoers promise one another nothing but deception."
"Surely, Allah holds the heavens and the earth lest they deviate (from their places). And if they did deviate, none can hold them after Him. Verily, He is Forbearing, Most Forgiving."
"And they swore by Allah their strongest oaths, that if a Warner came to them, they would follow guidance better than any other people. But when a Warner did come to them, it only increased them in aversion,"
Out of arrogance in the earth and evil plotting. But the evil plot encompasses none but the authors thereof. Do they then look for anything but (God’s) way of (dealing with) the peoples of old? But thou  wilt never find any change in the way of Allah; nor wilt thou ever find any alteration in the way of Allah.
"Have they not travelled in the earth and seen how (evil) was the end of those who were before them? And they were stronger than they in power. And Allah is not such that anything in the heavens or the earth should frustrate His (plans); verily, He is All-Knowing, All-Powerful."
"And if Allah were to punish people for what they do, He would not leave a living creature on the surface of (the earth); but He grants them respite until an appointed term; and when their appointed time comes, then (they will know that) Allah has all His servants under (His) eyes."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
Ya Sin.
"By the Qur’an, full of wisdom,"
"Thou art indeed (one) of the Messengers,"
On a right path.
" (This is) a revelation of the Mighty, the Merciful,"
"That thou mayest warn a people whose fathers were not warned, and so they are heedless."
"Surely the word has proved true against most of them, for they believe not."
"We have put round their necks, chains reaching unto the chins, so that their heads are forced up."
"And We have set a barrier before them and a barrier behind them, and have covered them over, so that they cannot see."
And it is equal to them whether thou warn them or warn them not: they will not believe.
Thou canst warn only him who would follow the Reminder and fear the Gracious (God) in secret. So give him the glad tidings of forgiveness and a noble reward.
"Surely, We (alone) give life to the dead, and We record that which they send forward and that which they leave behind; and all things have We recorded in a clear Book."
"And set forth to them the parable of a people of the town, when the Messengers came to it."
"When We sent to them two Messengers, and they rejected them both; so We strengthened (them) by a third, and they said, ‘Verily we have been sent to you as Messengers.’"
"They replied, ‘You are but men like us and the Gracious (God) has not revealed anything. You only lie.’"
"They said, ‘Our Lord knows that we are indeed (His) Messengers to you;"
‘And on us lies only the plain delivery of the Message.’
"They said, ‘Surely we augur evil fortune from you; if you desist not, we will certainly stone you, and a painful punishment will surely befall you at our hands.’"
"They replied, ‘Your evil fortune is with your own selves. Is it because you have been admonished? Nay, you are a people transgressing all bounds.’"
"And from the farthest part of the town there came a man running. He said, ‘O my people, follow the Messengers,"
"‘Follow those who ask of you no reward, and who are rightly guided."
"‘And what reason have I that I should not worship Him Who has created me, and unto Whom you will be brought back?"
"‘Shall I take others beside Him as gods? If the Gracious (God) should intend me any harm, their intercession will avail me naught, nor can they rescue me."
‘In that case I should indeed be in manifest error.
‘I believe in your Lord; so listen to me.’
"It was said (to him), ‘Enter Paradise.’ He said, ‘O, would that my people knew,"
‘How (graciously) my Lord has granted me forgiveness and has made me of the honoured ones!’
"And We sent not down against his people, after him, any host from heaven, nor did We need to send down (any)."
It was but a single blast and lo! they were extinct.
Alas for (My) servants! there comes not a Messenger to them but they mock at him.
"Have they not seen how many generations We have destroyed before them, (and) that they never return to them?"
"And all of them, gathered together, will certainly be brought before Us."
"And the dead earth is a Sign for them: We quicken it and bring forth therefrom grain, of which they eat."
"And We have placed in it gardens of date-palms and grapes, and We have caused springs to gush forth therein,"
"That they may eat of the fruit thereof, and it was not their hands that made them. Will they not then be grateful?"
"Holy is He Who created all things in pairs, of what the earth grows, and of themselves, and of what they know not."
"And a Sign for them is the night from which We strip off the day, and lo! they are in darkness."
"And the sun is moving on the course (prescribed) for it. That is the decree of the Almighty, the All- Knowing (God)."
"And for the moon We have appointed stages, till it becomes again like an old dry branch of a palm-tree."
"It is not for the sun to overtake the moon, nor can the night outstrip the day. All of them float in an orbit."
"And a Sign for them is that We carry their offspring in the laden ship,"
And We have created for them the like thereof whereon they ride.
"And if We (so) willed, We could drown them; then they would have no one to succour (them), nor would they be rescued,"
Except through mercy from Us and as a provision for a time.
"And when it is said to them, ‘Guard yourselves against that which is before you and that which is behind you, in order that you may receive mercy,’ (they turn away)."
"And there comes not to them any Sign out of the Signs of their Lord, but they turn away from it."
"And when it is said to them, ‘Spend out of that with which Allah has provided you,’ those who disbelieve say to those who believe, ‘Shall we feed him whom Allah would have fed, if He had (so) willed?  You are but in manifest error.’"
"And they say, ‘When will this promise (be fulfilled), if (indeed) you are truthful?’"
They are waiting only for a single blast which will seize them while they are disputing.
"And they will not be able to make a will, nor will they return to their families."
"And the trumpet shall be blown, and lo! from the graves they will hasten on to their Lord."
"They will say, ‘O! woe to us! who has raised us up from our place of sleep? This is what the Gracious (God) had promised, and the Messengers spoke the truth.’"
It will be but one blast and lo! they will all be brought before Us.
"And on that day, no soul will be wronged in aught; nor will you be rewarded but for what you used to do."
"Verily the inmates of Heaven will, on that day, be happy in (their) occupation."
"They and their wives will be in pleasant shades, reclining on raised couches."
"They will have fruits therein, and they will have whatever they call for."
‘Peace (on you)’ — a word (of greeting) from the Merciful Lord.
"And (God will say), ‘Separate yourselves (from the righteous) this day, O ye guilty ones!"
"‘Did I not enjoin on you, O ye sons of Adam, that you worship not  Satan — for he is to you an open enemy — "
‘And that you worship Me? This is the right path.
‘And he did lead astray a great multitude of you. Why did you not then understand?
‘This is the Hell which you were promised.
"‘Enter it this day, because you disbelieved.’"
"This day We shall put a seal on their mouths, and their hands will speak to Us, and their feet will bear witness to what they had earned."
"And if We had (so) willed, We could have put out their eyes, then they would have rushed to (find) the way. But how could they see?"
"And if We had (so) willed, We could have transformed them (so as to transfix them) in their places, then they would not be able to move forward or turn back."
And him whom We grant long life — We revert him to a weak (condition of) creation. Will they not then understand?
"And We have not taught him poetry, nor does that suit it (the Qur’an). It is but a Reminder and a Qur’an that makes (things) plain,"
"So that it may warn all who live, and that the word (of punishment) be justified against the disbelievers."
"Do they not see that, among the things which Our hands have fashioned, We have created for them cattle of which they are masters?"
"And We have subjected the same to them, so that some of them they use for riding and some (others) they eat."
And in them they have (other) benefits and (also) drinks. Will they not then be grateful?
"And they have taken (other) gods beside Allah, that they might be helped."
"They are not able to help them, but they will be brought (before God) as their (allied) host."
So let not their speech grieve thee. Verily We know what they conceal and what they proclaim.
Does not man see that We have created him from a (mere) spermdrop? Yet lo! he is an open quarreller!
"And he coins similitudes for Us and forgets his own creation. He says, ‘Who can quicken the bones when they are decayed?’"
"Say, ‘He, Who created them the first time, will quicken them; and He knows every (kind of) creation full well,"
"‘He Who produces for you fire out of the green tree, and behold, you kindle from it."
"‘Has not He Who created the heavens and the earth the power to create the like of them?’ Yea, and He is indeed the Supreme Creator, the All-Knowing."
"Verily His command, when He intends a thing, is (only) that He says to it, ‘Be!,’ and it is."
"So Holy is He, in Whose hand is the kingdom of all things. And to Him will you (all) be brought back."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"By those who range themselves in close ranks,"
"Then they drive away the enemy vigorously,"
"Then they recite the (Qur)’(an as a) Reminder,"
"Surely your God is One,"
Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them and the Lord of the sun’s risings.
We have adorned the lowest heaven with an adornment — the planets;
And have guarded it against all rebellious satans.
"They cannot hear (anything) from the exalted assembly (of angels) —  and they are pelted from every side,"
"Repulsed, and for them is a perpetual punishment — "
"Except him who snatches away (something) by stealth, and then there pursues him a piercing flame (of fire)."
"So ask them whether it is they who are harder to create, or (others) whom We have created? Them We have created of cohesive clay."
"Nay, thou dost wonder, and they ridicule."
"And when they are admonished, they pay no heed."
"And when they see a Sign, they seek to ridicule it."
"And they say, ‘This is nothing but plain magic."
"‘What! when we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we then be raised up (again)?"
‘And our forefathers of yore (also)?’
"Say, ‘Yea; and you will (then) be abased.’"
"Then it will be but one shout of reproach, and behold, they will begin to see."
"And they will say, ‘Alas for us! this is the Day of Requital."
‘This is the Day of the (final) decision which you used to deny.’
" (And it will be said to the angels), ‘Assemble those who acted wrongfully, along with their companions, and what they used to worship"
‘Beside Allah; and lead them to the path of the Fire;
‘And stop them; for they must be questioned.’
‘What is the matter with you that you help not one another?’
"Nay, on that day they will surrender themselves."
"And some of them will address the others, questioning one another."
"They will say, ‘Verily, you used to come to us, swearing (that you were truthful).’"
"They will answer, ‘Nay, you yourselves were not believers."
‘And we had no power over you; but you yourselves were a transgressing people.
‘Now the word of our Lord has been justified against us that we shall surely (have to) taste (the punishment).
‘And we caused you to go astray for we ourselves had gone astray.’
"Truly, on that day they will (all) be sharers in the punishment."
"Surely, thus do We deal with the guilty:"
"For when it was said to them, ‘There is no God but Allah,’ they turned away with disdain,"
"And said, ‘Shall we give up our gods for a mad poet?’"
"Nay, he has brought the truth and has testified to the truth of (all) the Messengers."
You shall surely taste the painful punishment.
And you will be rewarded only for what you have wrought — 
Save the chosen servants of Allah;
These will have a known provision;
"Fruits; and they shall be honoured,"
"In the Gardens of Bliss,"
" (Seated) on thrones, facing one another."
"They will be served round with a cup from a flowing fountain,"
" (Sparkling) white, delicious to the drinkers,"
"Wherein there will be no intoxication, nor will they be exhausted thereby."
"And with them will be (chaste) women, with restrained looks (and) large beautiful eyes,"
As though they were sheltered eggs.
"Then some of them will address the others, questioning one another."
"A speaker from among them will say, “I had a companion,"
"“Who used to say, ‘Art thou indeed among those who believe (it) to be true?"
"‘When we are dead, and have become dust and bones, shall we indeed be requited?’”"
"He will ask, ‘Will you have a look (at him)?’"
Then he will look and see him in the midst of the Fire.
"He will say, ‘By Allah, thou didst almost cause me to perish."
"‘And had it not been for the favour of my Lord, I should surely have been of those who are called up (before Him)."
"‘Is it (not so that) we are not going to die (again),"
"‘Save our previous death, and that we are not to be punished?"
‘Surely this is the supreme triumph.
"‘For the like of this, then, let the workers work.’"
"Is that better as an entertainment, or the tree of Zaqqum?"
Verily We have made it a trial for the wrongdoers.
It is a tree that springs forth in the bottom of Hell;
The fruit thereof is as though it were the heads of serpents.
And they shall eat of it and fill (their) bellies therewith.
Then will they have in addition to it a mixture of boiling water (as a drink).
Then surely their return shall be to Hell.
"They indeed found their fathers erring,"
And they hurried on in their footsteps.
"And most of the ancient peoples had erred before them,"
And We had sent Warners among them.
"Behold, then, how (evil) was the end of those who were warned,"
Save the chosen servants of Allah.
"And Noah indeed did cry unto Us, and what an excellent answer did We give (to his prayer)!"
And We saved him and his family from the great distress;
And We made his offspring the only survivors.
And We left for him (a good name) among the following generations — 
‘Peace be upon Noah among the peoples!’
Thus indeed do We reward those who do good.
He was surely (one) of Our believing servants.
Then We drowned the others.
And verily of his party was Abraham;
When he came to his Lord with a sound heart;
"When he said to his father and to his people, ‘What is it that you worship?"
‘Do you falsely seek gods beside Allah?
‘So what is your idea about the Lord of the worlds?’
"Then he cast a glance at the stars,"
"And said, ‘I am indeed (feeling) unwell.’"
So they went away from him turning their backs.
"Then he went secretly to their gods and said, ‘Will you not eat?"
‘What is the matter with you that you speak not?’
Then he began suddenly to strike them with the right hand.
Thereupon (the people) came towards him hastening.
"He said, ‘Do you worship that which you have (yourselves) carved out,"
‘Whereas Allah has created you and your handiwork?’
"They said, ‘Build for him a structure and cast him into the fire.’"
"Thus they intended an evil design against him, but We made them most humiliated."
"And he said, ‘I am going to my Lord, Who will guide me."
"‘My Lord, grant me a righteous (son).’"
So We gave him the glad tidings of a forbearing son.
"And when he was old enough to work with him, he said, ‘O my dear son, I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering thee. So consider, what thou thinkest (of it)!’ He replied, ‘O my father, do as thou art commanded; thou wilt find me, if Allah please, of those who are patient.’"
"And when they both submitted (to the Will of God), and he had thrown him down on his forehead,"
"We called to him: ‘O Abraham,"
‘Thou hast indeed fulfilled the dream.’ Thus indeed do We reward those who do good.
That surely was a manifest trial.
And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice.
And We left for him (a good name) among the following generations — 
‘Peace be upon Abraham!’
Thus do We reward those who do good.
"Surely, he was (one) of Our believing servants."
"And We gave him the glad tidings of Isaac, a Prophet, (and one) of the righteous."
And We bestowed blessings on him and Isaac. And among their progeny are (some) who do good and others who clearly wrong themselves.
"And, indeed, We bestowed favours on Moses and Aaron."
And We saved them both and their people from the great distress;
"And We helped them, and it was they who were victorious."
And We gave them the Book that made (things) clear;
And We guided them to the right path.
And We left for them (a good name) among the following generations — 
‘Peace be on Moses and Aaron!’
Thus indeed do We reward those who do good.
Surely they were both among Our believing servants.
"And assuredly Elias (also) was (one) of the Messengers,"
"When he said to his people, ‘Will you not fear God?"
"‘Do you call on Ba‘l, and forsake the Best of creators,"
"‘Allah, your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers of old?’"
"But they treated him as a liar, and they will surely be brought (before God to render an account);"
Except the chosen servants of Allah.
And We left for him (a good name) among the following generations — 
‘Peace be on Elias (and his people)!’
Thus indeed do We reward those who do good.
Surely he was (one) of Our believing servants.
"And assuredly Lot (too) was (one) of the Messengers,"
"When We delivered him and all his family,"
Except an old woman (who was) among those who stayed (behind).
Then We utterly destroyed the others.
"And surely you pass by them in the morning,"
And by night. Then why do you not understand?
"And surely Jonah (also) was (one) of the Messengers,"
When he fled to the laden ship;
And he cast lots (with the crew of the ship) and was of the losers.
And the fish swallowed him while he was blaming (himself).
"And had he not been of those who glorify (God),"
He would have surely tarried in its belly till the Day of Resurrection.
"Then We cast him on a bare tract of land, and he was sick;"
And We caused a plant of gourd to grow over him.
"And We sent him (as a Messenger) to a hundred thousand (people) or more,"
And they believed; so We gave them provision for a while.
Now ask them whether thy Lord has daughters whereas they have sons.
Did We create the angels females while they were witnesses?
"Now, surely it is one of their fabrications that they say,"
‘Allah has begotten (children);’ and they are certainly liars.
Has He chosen daughters in preference to sons?
What is the matter with you? How judge ye?
Will you not then reflect?
Or have you a clear authority?
"Then produce your Book, if you are truthful."
And they assert a blood relationship between Him and the Jinn while the Jinn (themselves) know that they will be brought (before God for judgment).
Holy is Allah (and free) from what they attribute (to Him).
But the chosen servants of Allah (do not do so).
"Verily, you and what you worship — "
"None of you can mislead (anyone) against Him,"
Except him who shall burn in Hell.
 (And the angels say): ‘And there is not one of us but has an appointed station.
"‘And, verily, we are those who stand ranged in ranks."
‘And we are verily those who glorify (God).’
"And surely they used to say,"
"‘If we had with us a Book (like that) of the people of old,"
‘We would surely have been Allah’s chosen servants.’
"Yet (when it is come to them) they disbelieve therein, but they will soon come to know."
"And surely Our word has gone forth respecting Our servants, the Messengers,"
That it is certainly they who would be helped;
And that it is Our host that would certainly be victorious.
So turn thou away from them for a while.
"And watch them, for they will soon see."
Is it then Our punishment that they seek to hasten on?
"But when it descends into their courtyard, it shall be an evil morning to those who were warned."
So turn thou away from them for a while.
"And watch, for they will soon see."
"Holy is thy Lord, the Lord of Honour (and Power), far above that which they assert."
And peace be upon the Messengers!
"And all praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of the worlds."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"Sad. By the Qur’an, full of exhortation, (it is Our revealed word)."
But those who disbelieve are (steeped) in (false) pride and enmity.
"How many a generation before them have We destroyed! They cried out (for help), but it was no longer the time for escape."
"And they wonder that a Warner has come to them from among themselves; and the disbelievers say, ‘This is a magician, a great liar."
‘Does he make the gods to be one God? This is indeed a strange thing.’
"And the leaders among them spoke out, ‘Go and stick to your gods. This is a thing designed."
‘We have not heard of this (even) in the latest religion. This is nothing but a fabrication.
"‘Has the exhortation been sent down to him (in preference to all) of us?’ Nay, they are in doubt concerning My exhortation. Nay, but they have not yet tasted My punishment."
"Do they possess the treasures of the mercy of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Great Bestower?"
Or is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them theirs? So let them ascend with the means (at their disposal).
 (They are) a host from among the confederates (which will be) routed here.
"Before them (too) the people of Noah, and (the tribe of) ‘Ad and Pharaoh, the lord of stakes, treated (the Messengers) as liars;"
"And (the tribe of) Thamud, and the people of Lot, and the dwellers of the Wood — these were the confederates."
"There was not one (of them) but treated (their) Messengers as liars, so My punishment rightly overtook (them)."
"And these only wait for a single blast, and there shall be no delaying it."
"They say, ‘Our Lord, hasten to us our portion (of the punishment) before the Day of Reckoning.’"
"Bear patiently what they say, and remember Our servant David, (man) of (strong) hands; surely he was always turning (to God)."
We subjected (to him) the mountains. They celebrated God’s praises with him at nightfall and sunrise.
And (We subjected to him) the birds gathered together: all turned to him.
"And We strengthened his kingdom, and gave him wisdom and decisive judgment."
And has the story of the disputants reached thee when they climbed over the wall of (his) chamber? — 
"When they entered in upon David, and he was afraid of them. They said, “Fear not. (We are) two disputants; one of us has transgressed against the other; so judge between us with justice, and deviate not from the right course and guide us to the right way."
"“This is my brother; he has ninety-nine ewes, and I have one ewe. Yet he says, ‘Give it to me,’ and has been overbearing to me in his address.”"
" (David) said, ‘Surely, he has wronged thee in demanding thy ewe in addition to his own ewes. And certainly many partners transgress against one another, except those who believe (in God) and do good works; and these are but few.’ And David perceived that We had tried him; so he asked forgiveness of his Lord, and fell down bowing in worship and turned (to Him)."
"So We forgave him that; and indeed, he had a position of nearness with Us and an excellent retreat."
"‘O David, We have made thee a vicegerent in the earth; so judge between men with justice, and follow not vain desire, lest it should lead thee astray from the way of Allah.’ Surely those who go astray from the way of Allah will have a severe punishment, because they forgot the Day of Reckoning."
"And We have not created the heaven and the earth and all that is between them in vain. That is the view of those who disbelieve. Woe, then, to the disbelievers because of the Fire."
Shall We treat those who believe and do good works like those who act corruptly in the earth? Shall We treat the righteous like the wicked?
" (This is) a Book which We have revealed to thee, full of blessings, that they may reflect over its verses, and that those gifted with understanding may take heed."
"And We bestowed on David, Solomon who was an excellent servant. He was always turning (to Us)."
"When there were brought before him at eventide steeds of noblest breed and swift of foot,"
"He said, ‘I love the love of horses because of the remembrance of my Lord.’ (So great was his love of them that) when they were hidden behind the veil, (he said),"
‘Bring them back to me.’ Then he began to pass his hand over (their) legs and (their) necks.
"And We did try Solomon and We placed on his throne a (mere) body. Then he turned (to God), (seeking His mercy)."
"He said, ‘O my Lord, grant me forgiveness and bestow on me a kingdom that will not suit anyone after me; surely Thou art the Great Bestower.’"
"So We subjected to him the wind, blowing gently by his command whithersoever he desired to go,"
"And the giants, all (sorts of) builders and divers,"
And others bound in fetters.
‘This is Our gift — so give freely or withhold — without reckoning.’
And certainly he had a position of nearness with Us and an excellent retreat.
"And remember Our servant Job, when he cried unto his Lord, (saying), ‘Satan has afflicted me with toil and torment.’"
‘Strike (and urge thy riding beast) with thy foot. Here is cool water to wash with and a drink.’
"And We bestowed on him his family and as many more with them, (by way of) mercy from Us, and as a reminder to men of understanding."
"And (We said to him), ‘Take in thy hand a handful of dry twigs and strike therewith, and break not thy oath.’ Indeed, We found him steadfast. An excellent servant was he. Surely, he was always turning (to God)."
"And remember Our servants Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, (men) of strong hands and (powerful) vision."
We chose them for a special (purpose) — reminding (people) of the abode (of the Hereafter).
"And truly, they are in Our sight among the elect (and) the best."
And remember Ishmael and Elisha and Dhu’l-Kifl; and all were of the best.
This is a reminder. And the righteous will surely have excellent retreat:
"Gardens of Eternity, with their gates thrown open to them,"
Reclining therein (on cushions); they will therein call (at pleasure) for plenteous fruit and drink.
"And with them will be (chaste women), restraining their looks, companions of equal age."
This is what you are promised for the Day of Reckoning.
"Verily, this is Our provision which will never be exhausted."
This is (for the believers). But for the rebellious there is an evil place of return — 
"Hell, wherein they will burn. What an evil resting-place!"
"This is (what they will have). So let them taste it: a boiling fluid, and an intensely cold and stinking drink."
And (various kinds of) other (torments) of a similar nature.
"‘This is a host (of yours) rushing headlong with you, (O leaders of mischief).’ No welcome for them. They must burn in the Fire."
"They will say, ‘Nay, it is you. No welcome for you (in truth). It is you who prepared this for us. So what an evil resting-place it is!’"
"They will (also) say, ‘Our Lord, whosoever prepared this for us — so add to him a double punishment in the Fire.’"
"And they will say, ‘What has happened to us that we see not the men whom we used to reckon among the wicked?"
"‘Is it because we subjected them to ridicule (unjustly), or have the eyes missed them?’"
"Surely, this is a fact — the disputing together of the people of the Fire."
"Say, ‘I am only a Warner; and there is no God but Allah, the One, the Most Supreme;"
"‘The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between the two, the Mighty, the Great Forgiver.’"
"Say, ‘It is a big news,"
‘From which you are turning away.
"‘I had no knowledge of the exalted Assembly when they discussed (it) among themselves,"
"‘But this that it has been revealed to me, that I am a plain Warner.’"
"When thy Lord said to the angels, ‘I am about to create man from clay,"
"‘And so when I have fashioned him (in perfection), and have breathed into him of My Spirit, fall ye down in submission to him.’"
"So the angels submitted, all of them together."
"But Iblis (did not). He behaved proudly, and was of those who disbelieved."
" (God) said, ‘O Iblis, what hindered thee from submitting to what I had created with My two hands? Is it that thou art (too) proud or art thou (really) of the exalted ones?’"
"He said, ‘I am better than he. Thou hast created me of fire and him hast Thou created of clay.’"
" (God) said, ‘Then get out hence, for, surely thou art rejected."
‘And surely on thee shall be My curse till the Day of Judgment.’
"He said, ‘My Lord, then grant me respite till the day when they shall be raised.’"
" (God) said, ‘Certainly thou art of those that are granted respite,"
‘Till the day of the appointed time.’
"He said, ‘So by Thy might, I will surely lead them all astray,"
‘Except Thy chosen servants from among them.’
" (God) said, ‘Then the truth is, and the truth I speak,"
"‘(That) I will certainly fill Hell with thee and with those who follow thee, all together.’"
"Say, ‘I ask not of you any reward for it, nor am I of those who are given to affectation."
‘It is nothing but a Reminder for (all) peoples.
‘And you shall surely know the truth of it after a while.’
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"The revelation of this Book is from Allah, the Mighty, the Wise."
"Surely it is We Who have revealed the Book to thee with truth; so worship Allah, being sincere to Him in obedience."
"Hearken, it is to Allah (alone) that sincere obedience is due. And those who take for protectors others beside Him (say), ‘We serve them only that they may bring us near to Allah in station.’ Surely, Allah will judge between them concerning that wherein they differ. Surely, Allah guides not him who is an ungrateful liar."
"If Allah had desired to take to Himself a son, He could have chosen whom He pleased out of what He creates. Holy is He! He is Allah, the One, the Most Supreme."
"He created the heavens and the earth in accordance with the requirements of wisdom. He makes the night to cover the day, and He makes the day to cover the night; and He has pressed the sun and the moon into service; each pursues (its) course until an appointed time. Hearken, (it is) He (alone Who) is the Mighty, the Great Forgiver."
"He created you from a single being; then from that He made its mate; and He has sent down for you eight (head) of cattle in pairs. He  creates you in the wombs of your mothers, creation after creation, in threefold darkness. This is Allah, your Lord. His is the kingdom. There is no God but He. Whither then are you being turned away?"
"If you are ungrateful, surely Allah is Self-Sufficient (being independent) of you. And He is not pleased with ingratitude in His servants. But if you show gratefulness, He likes it in you. And no bearer of burden shall bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord is your return; And He will inform you of what you have been doing. Surely, He knows full well all that is hidden in the breasts."
"And when an affliction befalls a man, he calls upon his Lord, turning (penitently) to Him. Then, when He confers upon him a favour from Himself, he forgets what he used to pray for before, and begins to assign rivals to Allah, that he may lead (men) astray from His way. Say, ‘Benefit thyself with thy disbelief a little while; thou art surely of the inmates of the Fire.’"
"Is he who prays devoutly (to God) in the hours of the night, prostrating himself and standing, (and) fears the Hereafter and hopes for the mercy of his Lord, (like him who does not do so)? Say, ‘Are those who know equal to those who know not?’ Verily, only those endowed with understanding will take heed."
"Say, ‘O ye My servants who believe, fear your Lord. There is good for those who do good in this life. And Allah’s earth is spacious. Verily the steadfast will have their reward without measure.’"
"Say, ‘Verily I am commanded to worship Allah, being sincere to Him in religion."
‘And I am commanded to be the first of those who submit (to Him).’
"Say, ‘Indeed I fear, if I disobey my Lord, the punishment of the great day.’"
"Say, ‘It is Allah I worship, being sincere to Him in my religion."
"‘So worship what you like beside Him.’ Say, ‘Surely the losers will be those who ruin their souls and (ruin) their families on the Day of Resurrection.’ Beware! that will surely be the manifest loss."
"They will have over them coverings of fire, and beneath them (similar) coverings. It is this against which Allah warns His servants. ‘O My servants, take Me, then, for your Protector.’"
"And those who shun false gods lest they worship them and turn to Allah — for them is glad tidings. So give glad tidings to My servants,"
"Who listen to the Word and follow the best thereof. It is they whom Allah has guided, and it is they who are men of understanding."
"Is he, then, against whom the sentence of punishment has become due (fit to be rescued)? Canst thou rescue him who is in the Fire?"
"But for them who fear their Lord there are lofty mansions built over lofty mansions, beneath which rivers flow. Allah has made that promise; (and) Allah breaks not (His) promise."
"Hast thou not seen that Allah sends down water from the sky, and causes it to flow in (the form of) streamlets in the earth and then brings forth thereby herbage, varying in its colours? Then it dries up and thou seest it turn yellow; then He reduces it to broken straw. In that verily is a reminder for men of understanding."
"Is he then whose bosom Allah has opened for (the acceptance of) Islam, so that he possesses a light from his Lord, (like him who is groping in the darkness of disbelief) ? Woe, then, to those whose hearts are hardened against the remembrance of Allah! They are in manifest error."
"Allah has sent down the best Message (in the form of) a Book, (whose verses are) mutually supporting (and) repeated (in diverse forms) at which do creep the skins of those who fear their Lord; then their skins and their hearts soften to the remembrance of Allah. Such is the guidance of Allah; He guides therewith whom He pleases. And he whom Allah adjudges astray — he shall have no guide."
"Is he, then, who has nothing but his own face to protect him with from the evil punishment on the Day of Resurrection (like him who is secure)? And it will be said to the wrongdoers, ‘Taste ye what you used to earn.’"
"Those who were before them rejected (Our Messengers), so the punishment came upon them whence they knew not."
"So Allah made them taste humiliation in the present life and the punishment of the Hereafter will certainly be greater, if they but knew!"
"And, indeed, We have set forth to men all kinds of parables in this Qur’an that they may take heed."
" (We have revealed) the Qur’an in Arabic wherein there is no deviation from rectitude, that they may become righteous."
"Allah sets forth a parable: a man belonging to several partners, disagreeing with one another, and a man belonging wholly to one man. Are they both equal in condition? All praise belongs to Allah. But most of them know not."
"Surely thou wilt die, and surely they (too) will die."
Then surely on the Day of Resurrection you will dispute with one another before your Lord.
"Who, then, is more unjust than he who lies against Allah or he who rejects the truth when it comes to him? Is there not in Hell an abode for the disbelievers?"
"But he who has brought the truth, and (he who) testifies to it (as such) —  these it is who are the righteous."
They will have with their Lord whatever they desire; that is the reward of those who do good.
"So that Allah will remove from them the evil (consequences) of what they did, and will give them their reward according to the best of their actions."
Is not Allah sufficient for His servant? And yet they would frighten thee with those beside Him.  And he whom Allah adjudges astray — for him there is no guide.
"And he whom Allah guides —  there is none to lead him astray. Is not Allah the Mighty, the Lord of retribution?"
"And if thou ask them, ‘Who created the heavens and the earth?’, they will surely say, ‘Allah.’ Say, ‘What think ye, if Allah intends to do me an injury, will those whom you call upon beside Allah be able to remove the injury inflicted by Him? Or if He wills to show me mercy, could they withhold His mercy?’ Say, ‘Allah is sufficient for me. In Him trust those who would trust.’"
"Say, ‘O my people, act as (best) you can; I (too) am acting; soon shall you know,"
"‘Who it is unto whom comes a punishment that will disgrace him, and on whom there descends an abiding punishment.’"
"Verily, We have revealed to thee the Book with truth for (the good of) mankind. So whoever follows guidance, (follows it) for the benefit of his own soul; and whoever goes astray, goes astray only to its detriment. And thou art not a guardian over them."
"Allah takes away the souls of human beings at the time of their death; and during their sleep of those (also) that are not (yet) dead. And then He retains those against which He has decreed death, and sends (back) the others till an appointed term. In that surely are Signs for a people who reflect."
"Have they taken intercessors beside Allah? Say, ‘Even if they have no power over anything and no intelligence?’"
"Say, ‘All intercession rests with Allah. To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. And to Him then shall you be brought back.’"
"And when Allah alone is mentioned the hearts of those who believe not in the Hereafter shrink with aversion; but when those beside Him are mentioned, behold, they begin to rejoice."
"Say, ‘O Allah! Originator of the heavens and the earth; Knower of the unseen and the seen; Thou (alone) wilt judge between Thy servants concerning that in which they differed.’"
"And even if the wrongdoers possessed all that is in the earth, and the like thereof in addition to it, they would surely (seek to) ransom themselves with it from the evil punishment on the Day of Resurrection; but there shall appear unto them, from Allah, that which they never thought of."
And the evil (consequences) of what they had earned will become apparent to them and that which they used to mock at will encompass them.
"And when trouble touches man, he cries unto Us. But when We bestow on him a favour from Us, he says, ‘This has been given to me on account of (my own) knowledge.’ Nay, it is only a trial; but most of them know not."
"Those who were before them said the same thing, yet all that they had earned availed them not;"
So the evil (consequences) of what they had earned overtook them; and those who do wrong from among these (disbelievers) — the evil (consequences) of what they earned shall also overtake them. They cannot escape.
"Know they not that Allah enlarges the provision for whomsoever He pleases, and straitens (it for whomsoever He pleases)? Verily, in that are Signs for a people who believe."
"Say, “O My servants who have committed excesses against their own souls! despair not of the mercy of Allah, surely Allah forgives all sins. Verily He is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"“And turn ye to your Lord, and submit yourselves to Him, before there comes unto you the punishment; (for) then you shall not be helped."
"“And follow the best (teaching) that has been revealed to you from your Lord, before the punishment comes upon you unawares, while you perceive not;"
"“Lest a soul should say, ‘O my grief for my remissness (in my duty) in respect of Allah! and surely I was among those who scoffed;’"
"“Or lest it should say, ‘If Allah had guided me, I should certainly have been among the righteous;’"
"“Or lest it should say, when it sees the punishment, ‘Would that  there were for me a return (to the world), I would then be among those who do good!’”"
" (God will answer), ‘Aye, there came to thee My Signs, but thou didst treat them as lies, and thou wast arrogant, and thou wast of the disbelievers.’"
"And on the Day of Resurrection, thou wilt see those who lied against Allah with their faces blackened. Is there not in Hell an abode for the proud?"
"And Allah will deliver the righteous (and lead them) to a place of security and success; evil shall not touch them, nor shall they grieve."
"Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is Guardian over all things."
"To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth; and as for those who disbelieve in the Signs of Allah, these it is who are the losers."
"Say, ‘Is it other (gods) than Allah that you bid me worship, O ye ignorant ones?’"
"And verily it has been revealed to thee as unto those before thee: ‘If thou attribute partners (to God), thy work shall surely go vain and thou shalt certainly be of the losers.’"
"Aye, worship Allah and be among the thankful."
"And they do not esteem Allah, with the esteem that is due to Him. And the whole earth will be (but) His handful on the Day of Resurrection,  and the heavens will be rolled up in His right hand. Glory to Him and exalted is He above that which they associate (with Him)."
"And the trumpet will be blown, and (all) who are in the heavens and (all) who are in the earth will (fall down in a) swoon, except those whom Allah will please (to exempt). Then will it be blown a second time, and lo! they will be standing, awaiting."
"And the earth will shine with the light of her Lord, and the Book will be laid (open before them), and the Prophets and the witnesses will be brought, and judgment will be given between them with justice, and they will not be wronged."
And every soul will be fully rewarded for what it did. And He knows full well what they do.
"And those who disbelieve will be driven to Hell in troops until, when they reach it, its gates will be opened, and its Keepers will say to them: ‘Did not Messengers from among yourselves come to you, reciting unto you the Signs of your Lord, and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours?’ They will say, ‘Yea, but the sentence of punishment has become justly due against the disbelievers.’"
"It will be said, ‘Enter ye the gates of Hell, abiding therein. And evil is the abode of the arrogant.’"
"And those who feared their Lord will be conducted to Heaven in groups until, when they reach it, and its gates are opened, and its Keepers say to them, ‘Peace be upon you! be ye happy, and enter it abiding (therein);’"
"And they will say, ‘All praise belongs to Allah Who has fulfilled His promise to us, and has given us the land for an inheritance, making our abode in the Garden wherever we please.’ How excellent then is the reward of the (righteous) workers!"
"And thou wilt see the angels going round the Throne, glorifying their Lord with (His) praise. And it will be judged between them with justice. And it will be said: ‘All praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.’"
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
Ha Mim.
"The revelation of the Book is from Allah, the Mighty, the All-Knowing,"
"The Forgiver of sin and the Acceptor of repentance, Severe in punishment, the Possessor of bounty. There is no God but He. Towards Him is the final return."
"None disputes about the Signs of Allah except those who disbelieve. Let not, then, their going about in the land deceive thee."
"The people of Noah and (other) groups after them denied (Our Signs) before these (people), and every nation strove to seize their Messenger, and disputed by means of false (arguments) that they might rebut the truth thereby. Then I seized them, and how (terrible) was My retribution!"
Thus was the word of thy Lord proved true against the disbelievers: that they are the inmates of the Fire.
"Those who bear the Throne, and those who are around it, glorify their Lord with (His) praise, and believe in Him, and ask forgiveness for those who believe, (saying): ‘Our Lord, Thou dost comprehend all things in (Thy) mercy and knowledge. So forgive those who repent and follow Thy way; and protect them from the punishment of Hell."
"‘And make them, our Lord, enter the Gardens of Eternity which Thou hast promised them, as well as such of their fathers and their wives and their children as are virtuous. Surely Thou art the Mighty, the Wise."
‘And protect them from evils; and he whom Thou dost protect from evils on that day — him hast Thou surely shown mercy. And that (indeed) is the supreme triumph.’
An announcement will be made to those who disbelieve (in the words): ‘Greater was the abhorrence of Allah when you were called to the faith and you disbelieved than your (own) abhorrence of yourselves (today).’
"They will say, ‘Our Lord, Thou hast caused us to die twice, and Thou hast given us life twice, and now we confess our sins. Is then there a way out?’"
" (It will be said to them), ‘This is because, when Allah was proclaimed as One, you disbelieved, but when partners were associated with Him, you believed. The decision (now) belongs only to Allah, the High, the Incomparably Great.’"
"He it is Who shows you His Signs, and sends down provision for you from heaven; but none pays heed save he who turns (to God)."
"Call ye then on Allah, being sincere to Him in religion, though the disbelievers may be averse."
" (He is) of most exalted attributes, Lord of the Throne. He sends the Word by His command to whomsoever of His servants He pleases, that He may give warning of the Day of Meeting,"
"The day when they will (all) come forth; nothing concerning them will be hidden from Allah. ‘Whose is the kingdom this day?’ ‘(It is) Allah’s, the One, the Most Supreme."
"‘This day will every soul be requited for that which it has earned. No injustice this day. Surely, Allah is Swift at reckoning.’"
"And warn them of the Approaching Day, when the hearts will reach to the throats while they will be full of suppressed grief. The wrongdoers will have no loving friend, nor any intercessor whose (intercession) will be complied with."
He knows the treachery of the eyes and what the breasts conceal.
"And Allah judges with truth, but those on whom they call beside Him cannot judge at all. Surely, Allah is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing."
"Have they not travelled in the earth and seen what was the end of those before them? They were mightier than these in power and (in) the marks (they left) in the earth. But Allah seized them for their sins, and  they had no protector against Allah."
"That was because their Messengers came to them with manifest Signs, but they disbelieved; so Allah seized them. Surely He is Powerful, Severe in punishment."
"And We did send Moses, with Our Signs and manifest authority,"
"Unto Pharaoh and Haman and Korah; but they said, ‘(He is) a magician and an impostor.’"
"And when he came to them with truth from Us, they said: ‘Slay the sons of those who have believed with him, and let their women live.’ But the design of the disbelievers is but a thing wasted."
And Pharaoh said: ‘Leave me (alone) that I may kill Moses; and let him call on his Lord. I fear lest he should change your religion or cause disorder to show itself in the land.’
"And Moses said, ‘I take refuge with my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant (person) who believes not in the Day of Reckoning.’"
"And a believing man from among the people of Pharaoh, who concealed his faith, said, “Will you slay a man because he says, ‘My Lord is Allah,’ while he has brought you clear proofs from your Lord? And if he be a liar, on him will be (the sin of) his lie; but if he is truthful, then some of that which he threatens you with will (surely) befall you. Certainly Allah guides not one who is a transgressor, (and) a liar."
"“O my people, yours is the sovereignty this day, you being dominant in the land. But who will help us (and protect us) from the punishment of Allah if it comes upon us?” Pharaoh said: ‘I only point out to you that which I see myself, and I guide you only to the path of rectitude."
"And he who believed said: “O my people, I fear for you (something) like the day of the parties,"
"“Like the case of the people of Noah, and ‘Ad and Thamud and those after them. And Allah intends no injustice to (His) servants."
"“And O my people, I fear for you the day of mutual calling (and wailing),"
“A day when you shall turn your backs fleeing. No defender shall you have against Allah. And for him whom Allah adjudges astray shall be no guide.
"“And Joseph did come to you before with clear proofs, but you ceased not to be in doubt concerning that with which he came to you till, when he died, you said: ‘Allah will never raise up a Messenger after him.’ Thus does Allah adjudge as lost those who transgress, (and) are doubters,"
"“Those who dispute concerning the Signs of Allah without any authority having come to them. Grievously hateful is this in the sight of Allah and in the sight of those who believe. Thus does Allah seal up the heart of every arrogant, haughty (person).”"
"And Pharaoh said: ‘O Haman, build thou for me a lofty building that I may attain to the means of approach,"
"‘The means of approach to the heavens, so that I may have a look at the God of Moses, and I surely think him to be a liar.’ And thus the evil of his doing was made (to look) fair in the eyes of Pharaoh, and he was turned away from the (right) path; and the design of Pharaoh ended in nothing but ruin."
"And he who believed said: ‘O my people, follow me. I will guide you to the path of rectitude."
"‘O my people, this life of the world is but a (temporary) provision; and the Hereafter is certainly the home for permanent stay."
"‘Whoso does evil will be requited only with the like of it; but whoso does good, whether male or female, and is a believer — these will enter the Garden; they will be provided therein without measure."
"‘And O my people, how (strange) it is that I call you to salvation, and you call me to the Fire."
"‘You invite me to disbelieve in Allah and to associate with Him that of which I have no knowledge, while I invite you to the Mighty, the Great Forgiver."
‘Surely that to which you call me has no (title) to be called upon in this world or in the Hereafter; and that our return is certainly to Allah and that the transgressors will be the inmates of the Fire.
"‘So you will soon remember what I say to you. And I entrust my cause to Allah. Verily, Allah sees (all His) servants.’"
"The result was that Allah preserved him from the evils of whatever they plotted, and a grievous punishment encompassed the people of Pharaoh — "
"The Fire. They are exposed to it morning and evening. And on the day when the Hour will come, (it will be said): ‘Cast Pharaoh’s people into the severest punishment.’"
"And when they will dispute with one another in the Fire, the weak will say to those who were proud, ‘Verily, we were your followers; will you then relieve us of a portion of the Fire?’"
"Those, who were proud, will say: ‘We are all in it. Allah has already judged between (His) servants.’"
"And those in the Fire will say to the Keepers of Hell, ‘Pray to your Lord that He may lighten for us the punishment for a (single) day.’"
"They will say: ‘Did not your Messengers come to you with manifest Signs?’ They will say: ‘Yea.’ (The Keepers) will say, ‘Then pray on.’ But the prayer of disbelievers is of no avail."
"Most surely We help Our Messengers and those who believe, (both) in the present life and on the day when the witnesses will stand forth,"
"The day when their excuses will not profit the wrongdoers, and theirs will be the curse and theirs the evil abode."
"And indeed We gave Moses the guidance, and made the children of Israel the inheritors of the Book — "
A guidance and a reminder for men of understanding.
"So have patience. Surely the promise of Allah is true. And ask forgiveness for thy frailty, and glorify thy Lord with His praise in the evening and in the morning."
"Those who dispute concerning the Signs of Allah without any authority having come to them —  there is nothing in their breasts but (a feeling of) greatness which they will never attain. So seek refuge in Allah. Surely He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing."
"Certainly, the creation of the heavens and the earth is greater than the creation of mankind; but most men know not."
And the blind and the seeing are not equal; neither are those who believe and do good deeds (equal to) those who do evil. Little do you reflect.
The Hour will surely come; there is no doubt about it; yet most men believe not.
"And your Lord says: ‘Pray unto Me; I will answer your (prayer). But those who are too proud to worship Me will surely enter Hell, despised.’"
"It is Allah Who has made the night for you that you may rest therein, and the day (to enable you) to see. Verily, Allah is the Lord of bounty for mankind, yet most men are ungrateful."
"Such is Allah, your Lord, the Creator of all things. There is no God but He. How then are you turned away?"
Thus indeed are turned away those who deny the Signs of Allah.
"Allah it is Who has made for you the earth a resting-place, and the heaven a canopy, and has given you shape and made your shapes perfect, and has provided you with good things. Such is Allah, your Lord. So blessed is Allah, the Lord of the worlds."
"He is the Living (God). There is no God but He. So pray unto Him, being sincere to Him in religion. All praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of the worlds."
"Say, ‘I have been forbidden to worship those whom you call upon beside Allah since there have come unto me clear proofs from my Lord; and I have been commanded to submit myself to the Lord of the worlds.’"
"He it is Who created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then from a clot; then He brings you forth as a child; then (He lets you grow) that you may attain your full strength; then (He lets) you become old —  though some among you are caused to die before — and (He lets you live) that you may reach a term appointed, and that you may learn wisdom."
"He it is Who gives life and causes death. And when He decrees a thing, He says to it only, ‘Be!,’ and it is."
Hast thou not seen those who dispute concerning the Signs of Allah? How they are being turned away (from the truth)!
"Those who reject the Book and that with which We sent Our Messengers. But soon will they come to know,"
"When the iron-collars will be round their necks, and chains (too.) They will be dragged"
Into boiling water; then in the Fire will they be burnt.
"Then it will be said to them, ‘Where are those whom you associated (with God)"
"‘Beside Allah?’ They will say, ‘They have vanished away from us. Nay, we never prayed to anything before.’ Thus will Allah confound the disbelievers."
"‘That is because you exulted in the earth without justification, and because you behaved insolently."
"‘Enter ye the gates of Hell, to abide therein. And evil is the abode of the proud.’"
"Then have patience. Surely, the promise of Allah is true. And whether We show thee part of what We have promised them, or whether We cause thee to die (before the fulfilment of Our promise), to Us (in any case) will they be brought back."
"And We did send Messengers before thee; of them are some whom We have mentioned to thee, and of them there are some whom We have not mentioned to thee; and it is not possible for any Messenger to bring a Sign except by the leave of Allah. But when Allah’s decree came, the matter was decided with truth, and then there perished those who uttered falsehoods."
"It is Allah Who has made cattle for you, that you may ride on some of them, and eat of some of them — "
"And you have (other) advantages in them — and that, by means of them, you may satisfy any desire (that there may be) in your breasts. And on them and on ships are you borne."
And He shows you His Signs; which then of the Signs of Allah will you deny?
"Have they not travelled in the earth that they might see what was the end of those who were before them? They were more numerous than these, and mightier in power and (in) the marks (they left behind them) in the earth. But all that which they earned was of no avail to them."
"And when their Messengers came to them with manifest Signs, they exulted in the knowledge which they possessed. And that at which they mocked encompassed them."
"And when they saw Our punishment, they said: ‘We believe in Allah alone and we reject all that which we used to associate with Him.’"
But their faith could not profit them (at the time) when they saw Our punishment. This is Allah’s law that has (ever) been in operation in respect of His servants. And thus have perished those who disbelieved.
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
Ha Mim.
" (This is) a revelation from the Gracious, the Merciful."
"A Book, the verses of which have been expounded in detail — the Qur’an in clear, eloquent language —  for a people who have knowledge,"
A bringer of glad tidings and a warner. But most of them turn away and they hear not.
"And they say: ‘Our hearts are under covers (and are protected) against that to which thou callest us, and in our ears there is a deafness, and between us and thee there is a screen. So carry on thy work; we (too) are working.’"
"Say, ‘I am only a man like you. It is revealed to me that your God is One God; so go ye straight to Him (without deviating), and ask forgiveness of Him.’ And woe to the idolaters,"
"Who give not the Zakat, and they it is who deny the Hereafter."
" (As to) those who believe and do good works, they will surely have a reward that will never end."
Say: ‘Do you really disbelieve in Him Who created the earth in two days? And do you set up equals to  Him?’ That is the Lord of the worlds.
"He placed therein firm mountains rising above its (surface), and blessed it (with abundance), and provided therein its foods in proper measure in four days — alike for (all) seekers."
"Then He turned to the heaven while it was (something like) smoke, and said to it and to the earth: ‘Come ye both of you, willingly or unwillingly.’ They said, ‘We come willingly.’"
"So He completed them into seven heavens in two days, and He revealed to each heaven its function. And We adorned the lowest heaven with lamps (for light) and for protection. That is the decree of the Mighty, the All-Knowing."
"But if they turn away, then say: ‘I warn you of a destructive punishment like the punishment which (overtook) ‘Ad and Thamud.’"
"When their Messengers came to them from before them and behind them, (saying): ‘Worship none but Allah,’ they said: ‘If our Lord had (so) willed, He would have certainly sent down angels. So we do disbelieve in that with which you have been sent.’"
"As for ‘Ad, they behaved arrogantly in the earth without any justification and said, ‘Who is mightier than we in power?’ Do they not see that Allah, Who created them, is mightier than they in power? Still they continued to deny Our Signs."
"So We sent upon them a furious wind for several ominous days, that We might make them taste the  punishment of humiliation in this life. And the punishment of the Hereafter will surely be more humiliating, and they will not be helped."
"And as for Thamud, We gave them guidance, but they preferred blindness to guidance, so the calamity of a humiliating punishment seized them, on account of what they had earned."
And We saved those who believed and acted righteously.
"And on the day when the enemies of Allah will be gathered together and driven to the Fire, they will be goaded on."
"Till, when they reach it, their ears and their eyes and their skins will bear witness against them as to what they had been doing."
"And they will say to their skins: ‘Why bear ye witness against us?’ They will say: ‘Allah has made us to speak as He has made everything (else) to speak. And He it is Who created you the first time, and unto Him have you been brought back."
"‘And you did not fear (while committing sins) that your ears and your eyes and your skins would bear witness against you, nay, you thought that (even) Allah did not know much of what you used to do."
"‘And that thought of yours, which you entertained concerning your Lord, has ruined you. So (now) you have become of those who are lost.’"
"Now if they can endure, the Fire is their abode; and if they ask for  forgiveness, they are not of those whom forgiveness can be shown."
"And We had assigned for them companions who made (to appear) attractive to them what was before them and what was behind them; and the sentence became due against them along with the communities of Jinn and mankind that had gone before them. Surely, they were (the) losers."
"And those who disbelieve say: ‘Listen not to this Qur’an, but make noise during its (recital) that you may have the upper hand.’"
"And most certainly We will make those who disbelieve taste a severe punishment, and, most certainly, We will requite them for the worst of their deeds."
That is the reward of the enemies of Allah — the Fire. For them there will be an abiding home therein as a requital because they used to deny Our Signs.
"And those who disbelieve will say, ‘Our Lord, show us those who led us astray from among both the Jinn and men, that we may put them under our feet so that both of them may become of the lowest.’"
" (As for) those who say, ‘Our Lord is Allah,’ and then remain steadfast, the angels descend on them, (saying): ‘Fear ye not, nor grieve; and rejoice in the Garden that you were promised."
"‘We are your friends in this life and in the Hereafter. Therein you will have all that your souls will  desire, and therein you will have all that you will ask for — "
"‘An entertainment from the Most Forgiving, the Merciful.’"
"And who is better in speech than he who invites (men) to Allah and does good works and says, ‘I am surely of those who submit?’"
"And good and evil are not alike. Repel (evil) with that which is best. And lo, he between whom and thyself was enmity will become as though he were a warm friend."
But none is granted it save those who are steadfast; and none is granted it save those who possess a large share of good.
"And if an incitement from Satan incite thee, then seek refuge in Allah. Surely He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing."
"And among His Signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon. Prostrate not yourselves before the sun, nor before the moon, but prostrate yourselves before Allah, Who created them, if it is Him Whom you (really) worship."
"But if they turn away with disdain (they do it to their own detriment), while those who are with thy Lord glorify Him night and day, and they are never wearied."
"And among His Signs is (this): that thou seest the earth (lying) withered, but when We send down water on it, it stirs and swells (with verdure). Surely, He Who quickened it can quicken the dead. Verily He  has power over all things."
"Surely, those who deviate (from the right path) with respect to Our Signs are not hidden from Us. Is he, then, who is cast into the Fire better or he who comes out safe on the Day of Resurrection? Do what you will. Surely He sees all that you do."
"Those who disbelieve in the Reminder when it comes to them (are the losers). And, truly, it is a mighty Book."
"Falsehood cannot approach it (either) from before or from behind it. (It is) a revelation from the Wise, the Praiseworthy."
Nothing is said to thee but what was said to the Messengers before thee. Thy Lord is indeed the Master of forgiveness; and (also) the Master of painful chastisement.
"And if We had made it a Qur’an in a foreign tongue, they surely would have said, ‘Why have not its verses been made clear? What! a foreign tongue and an Arab?’ Say, ‘It is a guidance and a healing for those who believe.’ But (as to those) who believe not, there is a deafness in their ears, and it is blindness for them. They are, (as it were), being called to from a far off place."
"And We did give Moses the Book, but differences were created concerning it; and had it not been for a word that had gone before from thy Lord, (the matter) would have been decided between them; and certainly they are in a disquieting doubt about it."
"Whoso does right, it is for his own soul; and whoso does evil, it will (only go) against it. And thy Lord is not at all unjust to (His) servants."
"To Him (alone) is referred the knowledge of the Hour. And no fruits come forth from their spathes, nor does any female bear (a child), nor does she give birth (to it), but with His knowledge. And on the day when He will call unto them, (saying), “Where are My ‘Partners’?” they will say, ‘We declare unto Thee, not one of us is a witness (thereto).’"
"And all that they used to call upon before will be lost to them, and they will know for certain that they have no place of escape."
"Man does not tire of praying for good; but if evil touch him, he despairs, (and) gives up (all) hope."
"And if We make him taste of mercy from Ourself, after (some) affliction that has befallen him, he will surely say, ‘This is my due; and I do not think the Hour will (ever) come. But if I am returned to my Lord, I shall surely have with Him the very best.’ Then We will surely tell the disbelievers all that they did, and We will certainly make them taste hard punishment."
"And when We bestow a favour on man, he goes away, turning aside; but when evil touches him, lo! he (starts) offering long prayers."
"Say, ‘Tell me: if it is from Allah but you disbelieve in it — who is more astray than one who has drifted away (from Allah)?’"
"Soon We will show them Our Signs in all parts (of the earth), and among their own people until it becomes manifest to them that it is the truth. Is it not enough that thy Lord is Witness over all things?"
"Aye, they are surely in doubt concerning the meeting with their Lord. Aye, He certainly encompasses all things."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
Ha Mim.
‘Ain Sin Qaf.
"Thus has Allah, the Mighty, the Wise, been revealing to thee and to those that preceded thee."
"To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and He is the High, the Great."
"The heavens may well-nigh rend asunder from above them; and the angels glorify their Lord with His praise and ask forgiveness for those on the earth. Behold! it is surely Allah Who is the Most Forgiving, the Merciful."
"And (as for) those who take (for themselves) protectors beside Him, Allah watches over them; and thou art not a guardian over them."
"Thus have We revealed to thee the Qur’an in Arabic, that thou mayest warn the Mother of towns, and all around it; and (that) thou mayest warn (them) of the Day of Gathering whereof there is no doubt: A party (will be) in the Garden, and a party in the blazing Fire."
"And if Allah had (so) pleased, He could have made them one people; but He admits into His mercy whomsoever He pleases. And (as for) the wrongdoers, they will have no protector and no helper."
"Have they taken (for themselves) protectors other than Him? But it is Allah Who is the (real) Protector. And He quickens the dead, and He has power over all things."
"And in whatsoever you differ, the decision thereof (rests) with Allah. (Say): ‘Such is Allah, my Lord; in Him I put my trust, and to Him I (always) turn.’"
" (He is) the Maker of the heavens and the earth. He has made for you pairs of your own selves, and of the cattle (also He has made) pairs. He multiplies you therein. There is nothing whatever like unto Him; and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing."
"To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth. He enlarges the provision for whomsoever He pleases and straitens (it for whomsoever He pleases). Surely, He knows all things full well."
"He has prescribed for you the religion which He enjoined on Noah, and which We have revealed to thee, and which We enjoined on Abraham and Moses and Jesus, (saying), ‘Remain steadfast in obedience, and be not divided therein. Hard upon the idolaters is that to which thou callest them.  Allah chooses for Himself whom He pleases, and guides to Himself him who turns (to Him).’"
"And they did not become divided but after knowledge had come to them, through jealousy among themselves. And had it not been for a word that had already gone forth from thy Lord for an appointed term, (the matter) would surely have been decided between them. And surely those who were made to inherit the Book after them are in a disquieting doubt concerning it."
"To this, then, do thou invite (mankind). And be thou steadfast as thou art commanded, and follow not their evil inclinations, but say, ‘I believe in whatever Book Allah has sent down, and I am commanded to judge justly between you. Allah is our Lord and your Lord. For us is the reward of our works, and for you the reward of your works. There is no quarrel between us and you. Allah will gather us together, and to Him is the return.’"
And those who dispute concerning Allah after He has been accepted — their dispute is futile in the sight of their Lord; and on them is (God)’(s) wrath and for them will be a severe punishment.
Allah it is Who has sent down the Book with truth and (also) the Balance. And what will make thee know that the Hour may be near at hand?
"Those who believe not therein seek to hasten it; but those who believe are fearful of it, and know that it is the truth. Beware! those who dispute concerning the Hour are in error, far gone."
"Allah is Benignant to His servants. He provides for whom He pleases. And He is the Powerful, the Mighty."
"Whoso desires the harvest of the Hereafter, We give him increase in his harvest; and whoso desires the harvest of this world, We give him (thereof), but in the Hereafter he will have no share."
"Have they (such) associates (of Allah) as have made lawful for them in religion that which Allah has not allowed? And but for (Our) word about the final judgment, (the matter) would have been decided (by now) between them. And surely the wrongdoers will have a grievous punishment."
"Thou wilt see the wrongdoers in fear on account of that which they have earned, and it is sure to befall them. But those who believe and do good works will be in the meadows of the Gardens. They shall have with their Lord whatever they will desire. That is the great bounty (of God)."
"This it is whereof Allah gives the glad tidings to His servants who believe and do good works. Say: ‘I ask of you no reward for it, except (that I am inviting you to God because of) love of kinship.’ And whoso earns a good deed, We give him increase of good therein. Surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Most Appreciating."
"Do they say, ‘He has forged a lie against Allah?’ If Allah had (so) willed, He could seal thy heart (as He) (has sealed the hearts of thy enemies). But Allah is blotting out falsehood (through thee) and is establishing the truth by His words. Surely, He knows full well what is in the breasts."
"And He it is Who accepts repentance from His servants, and forgives sins. And He knows what you do."
"And He accepts (the prayers of) those who believe and do good works, and gives them more out of His grace; and (as for) the disbelievers, they will have a severe punishment."
"And if Allah should enlarge the provision for His servants, they would rebel in the earth; but He sends down according to a (proper) measure as He pleases. Indeed, He is All-Aware and All-Seeing with regard to His servants."
"And He it is Who sends down rain after they have despaired, and spreads out His mercy. And He is the Protector, the Praiseworthy."
"And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and (of) whatever living creatures He has spread forth in both. And He has the power to gather them together when He pleases."
"And whatever misfortune befalls you, is due to what your own hands have wrought. And He forgives many (of your sins)."
And you cannot frustrate (God)’(s plan) in the earth; nor have you any friend or helper beside Allah.
And of His Signs are the sailingships on the sea like mountain tops:
"If He (so) will, He can cause the wind to become still so that they become motionless upon the surface thereof — in that, surely, are Signs for every person who is most patient and grateful — "
Or He can destroy them because of that which they (the men) have earned — but He forgives many (of their sins) — 
And (He destroys them so that) those who dispute about the Signs of Allah may know (that) they have no refuge.
"And whatever you have been given is only a temporary provision of this life, but that which is with Allah is better and more lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord,"
"And who eschew the more grievous sins and indecencies, and, when they are wroth, they forgive,"
"And those who hearken to their Lord, and observe Prayer, and whose affairs are (decided) by mutual consultation, and who spend out of what We have provided for them,"
"And those who, when a wrong is done to them, defend themselves."
"And the recompense of an injury is an injury the like thereof; but whoso forgives and (his act) brings about reformation, his reward is with Allah. Surely, He loves not the wrongdoers."
But there is no blame on those who defend themselves after they have been wronged.
The blame is only on those who wrong men and transgress in the earth without justification. Such will have a grievous punishment.
And he who is patient and forgives — that surely is a matter of strong determination.
"And he whom Allah adjudges astray — there is no protector for him thereafter. And thou wilt find the wrongdoers, when they see the punishment, saying: ‘Is there any way of return?’"
"And thou wilt see them brought before it (the Fire), casting down (their eyes) on account of disgrace, looking (thereat) with a stealthy glance. And those who believe will say, ‘The losers indeed are those who ruin themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection.’ Behold! the wrongdoers are (to remain) in a lasting punishment."
And they have no helpers to help them other than Allah. And for him whom Allah adjudges astray there is no way (at all).
"Hearken ye to your Lord before there comes a day for which there will be no averting in opposition to (the decree of) Allah. There will be no refuge for you on that day, nor will there be for you any (possibility of) denial."
"But if they turn away, We have not sent thee as a guardian over them. Thy duty is only to convey (the Message). And truly when We cause man to taste of mercy from Us, he rejoices therein. But if an evil befalls them because of what their hands have sent forth, then lo! man is ungrateful."
"To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He creates what He pleases. He bestows daughters upon whom He pleases, and He bestows sons upon whom He pleases;"
"Or He mixes them, males and females; and He makes whom He pleases barren. Surely, He is All- Knowing, Powerful."
"And it is not for a man that Allah should speak to him except by revelation or from behind a veil or by sending a messenger to reveal by His command what He pleases. Surely, He is High, Wise."
"And thus have We revealed to thee the Word by Our command. Thou didst not know what the Book was, nor what the faith. But We have made it (the revelation) a light, whereby We guide such of Our servants as We please. And truly, thou guidest (mankind) to the right path,"
"The path of Allah, to Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. Behold! to Allah do all things return."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
Ha Mim.
"By this perspicuous Book,"
"We have made it a Qur’an in clear, eloquent language that you may understand."
"And surely, it is (safe) with Us in the Mother of the Book, exalted (and) full of wisdom."
"Shall We then take away the Reminder from you, neglecting (you) because you are an extravagant people?"
And how many a Prophet did We send among the earlier peoples!
But there never came to them a Prophet but they mocked at him.
"And We destroyed (those) who were stronger in power than these, and the example of the earlier peoples has gone before."
"And if thou ask them, ‘Who created the heavens and the earth?’, they will surely say, ‘The Mighty, the All-Knowing (God) created them.’"
" (He), Who has made the earth for you a cradle, and has made pathways, for you therein, that you may follow the right way;"
"And Who sends down water from the sky in proper measure, and We thereby quicken a dead land; —  even so will you be raised; — "
"And Who has created all the pairs, and has made for you ships and cattle whereon you ride,"
"That you may sit firmly upon their backs, (and) then, when you are firmly seated thereon, you may remember the favour of your Lord, and say, ‘Holy is He Who has subjected this to us, and we had not the strength to subdue it (ourselves)."
‘And to our Lord surely shall we return.’
And a portion of His servants they assert to be His (children). Indeed man is clearly ungrateful.
"Has He taken daughters from what He has created, and honoured you with sons?"
"Yet when tidings are given to one of them of that the like of which he ascribes to the Gracious (God), his face becomes darkened and he is choked with grief."
" (Do you ascribe to God) one who is reared among ornaments, and who is not clear in disputation?"
"And they describe the angels, who are the servants of the Gracious (God), as females. Did they witness their creation? Then their testimony will be recorded, and they shall be questioned."
"And they say, ‘If the Gracious (God) had (so) willed, we should not have worshipped them.’ They have no knowledge whatsoever of that. They do nothing but conjecture."
"Have We given them a Scripture before this, so that they are holding fast to it?"
"Nay, they say, ‘We found our fathers following a (certain) course, and we are guided by their footsteps.’"
"And thus (has it always been) that We never sent any Warner before thee to any township but the evil leaders thereof said: ‘We found our fathers following a (certain) course, and we are following in their footsteps.’"
 (Their Warner) said: ‘What! even though I bring you a better guidance than that which you found your fathers following?’ They said: ‘Certainly we disbelieve in that which you are sent with.’
So We punished them. Behold then what was the end of those who rejected (the Prophets)!
"And (remember) when Abraham said to his father and his people: ‘I (positively) disown what you worship,"
"‘Except Him Who created me, and He will surely guide me.’"
"And He made it a byword to last among his posterity, that they might turn (to God)."
"Nay, but I allowed them and their fathers (temporary) enjoyment until there came to them the truth and a Messenger who makes (his Message) clear."
"But when the truth came to them they said, ‘This is magic, and we do reject it.’"
"And they say, ‘Why has not this Qur’an been sent to some great man of the two towns?’"
"Is it they who would distribute the mercy of thy Lord? It is We Who distribute among them their livelihood in the present life, and We exalt some of them above others in degrees (of rank), so that some of them may make others subservient (to themselves). And the mercy of thy Lord is better than that which they amass."
"And were it not that mankind would have (all) become one (type of) people, We would have given to those who disbelieve in the Gracious (God), roofs of silver for their houses, and (silver) stairways by which they could go up;"
"And doors (of silver) to their houses, and couches (of silver), on which they could recline,"
And (other articles of) embellishment. But all that is nothing but a (temporary) provision of the present life. And the Hereafter with thy Lord is for the righteous.
"And he who turns away from the remembrance of the Gracious (God), We appoint for him a satan, who becomes his companion."
"And surely they hinder them from the way (of God), but they think that they are rightly guided;"
"Till, when such a one comes to Us, he says (to his companion), ‘Would that between me and thee were the distance of the East and the West!’ What an evil companion is he!"
‘And (the fact) that you are partners in punishment will not profit you this day for you have acted wrongfully.’
"Canst thou, then, make the deaf hear, or guide the blind and him who is in manifest error?"
"And if We take thee away, We shall surely exact retribution from them,"
Or We shall show thee that which We have promised them; for surely We have complete power over them.
So hold thou fast to that which has been revealed to thee; for thou art on the right path.
"And, truly, it is (a source of) eminence for thee and for thy people; and you will be inquired about."
"And ask those of Our Messengers whom We sent before thee, ‘Did We appoint any deities beside the Gracious (God), to be worshipped?’"
"And We did send Moses with Our Signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs, and he said, ‘I am truly a Messenger of the Lord of the worlds.’"
"But when he came to them with Our Signs, lo! they laughed at them."
"And We showed them no Sign but it was greater than its (preceding) sister, and We seized them with punishment, that they might turn (to Us)."
"And they said, ‘O thou magician, pray for us to thy Lord, according to the covenant He has made with thee: for, then we will surely accept guidance.’"
"But when We removed the punishment from them, behold! they broke their word."
"And Pharaoh proclaimed among his people, (saying), ‘O my people! does not the kingdom of Egypt belong to me and these streams flowing under me? Do you not then see?"
"‘Nay, I am better than this (fellow) who is despicable and can scarcely express (himself) clearly."
"‘And why have not bracelets of gold been bestowed on him, or angels accompanied him in serried ranks?’"
"Thus did he make light of his people, and they obeyed him. Indeed they were a wicked people."
"So, when they excited Our anger, We exacted retribution from them, and drowned them all."
"And We made them a precedent, and an example for the coming generations."
"And when the son of Mary is mentioned as an instance, lo! thy people raise a clamour thereat;"
"And they say, ‘Are our gods better, or he?’ They mention not this to thee but for (the sake of) disputation. Nay, but they are a contentious people."
"He was only Our servant on whom We bestowed Our favour, and We made him an example for the children of Israel."
"And if We (so) willed, We could make from among you angels in the earth to be successors (therein)."
"But verily, he was a sign of the Hour. So have no doubt about it, but follow me. This is the right path."
"And let not Satan hinder you. Surely, he is to you an open enemy."
"And when Jesus came with clear proofs, he said, ‘Truly I am come to you with wisdom, and to make clear to you some of that about which you differ. So fear Allah and obey me."
‘Verily Allah — He is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him. This is the right path.’
But the parties differed among themselves. So woe to the wrongdoers because of the punishment of a grievous day.
"They wait not but for the Hour to come suddenly upon them, while they perceive (it) not."
"Friends on that day will be foes to each other, except the righteous."
"‘O My servants, there is no fear for you this day, nor shall you grieve;"
"‘(You) who believed in Our Signs and submitted,"
"‘Enter ye the Garden, you and your wives, honoured and happy.’"
"To them will be passed round dishes of gold and cups, and therein will be all that the souls desire and (in which) the eyes delight. ‘And therein will you abide."
‘And this is the Garden to which you have been made heirs because of what you have been doing.
"‘Therein for you is fruit in abundance, which you will eat.’"
The guilty will certainly abide in the punishment of Hell.
"It will not be mitigated to them, and they will be seized therein with despair."
"And We wronged them not, but it was they themselves who were the wrongdoers."
"And they will cry: ‘O master! let thy Lord finish with us.’ He will say, ‘You must remain.’"
 (God will say): ‘We certainly brought you the truth; but most of you were averse to the truth.’
Have they determined upon a course? Then We (too) are determined.
Do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsels? Yea! And Our messengers remain with them recording (everything).
"Say, ‘If there had been a son to the Gracious (God), I would have been the first of worshippers.’"
"Holy is (Allah), the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne, (and He is free) from all that which they attribute (to Him)."
So leave them alone to indulge in vain discourse and amuse themselves until they meet that Day of theirs which they have been promised.
"And He it is Who is God in heaven, and God on earth; and He is the Wise, the All-Knowing."
"And blessed is He to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, and with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, and to Him shall you be brought back."
"And those on whom they call beside Him possess no power of intercession but he who bears witness to the truth, and they know (him)."
"And if thou ask them, ‘Who created them?’, they will surely say, ‘Allah’. How then are they being turned away?"
 (I swear) by his (repeated) cry ‘O my Lord!’ that these are a people who will not believe.
"Therefore, turn aside from them, and say, ‘Peace’; and soon shall they know."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
Ha Mim.
By this perspicuous Book.
"Truly, We revealed it in a blessed Night. Truly, We have (ever) been warning (against evil)."
"In it all wise things are decided,"
" (By) Our (own) command. Verily, We have ever been sending (Messengers),"
"As a mercy from thy Lord. Verily, He is the All-Hearing, the All-knowing,"
"The Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, if you would (only) have faith."
"There is no God but He. He gives life and He causes death. He is your Lord, and the Lord of your forefathers."
Yet they play about in doubt.
"But watch thou for the day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke,"
That will envelop the people. This will be a painful torment.
" (Then will the people cry): ‘Our Lord, remove from us the torment; truly, we are believers.’"
"How can they benefit by admonition, when there has already come to them a Messenger, explaining things clearly,"
"And yet they turned away from him and said: ‘He is tutored, a man possessed?’"
"We shall remove the punishment for a little while, (but) you will certainly revert (to disbelief)."
"On the day when We shall seize (you) with the great seizure, then certainly We will exact retribution."
"And We tried the people of Pharaoh before them, and there came to them a noble Messenger,"
" (Saying), ‘Deliver to me the servants of Allah. Truly, I am to you a Messenger, faithful to (my) trust;"
"‘And exalt not yourselves in defiance of Allah. Surely, I come to you with a clear authority."
"‘And I seek refuge in my Lord and your Lord, lest you stone me."
"‘And if you believe me not, then keep yourselves away from me.’"
"Then he prayed unto his Lord, (saying), ‘These are indeed a sinful people.’"
" (God said), ‘Take My servants away by night; for you will surely be pursued."
"‘And leave thou the sea (at a time when it is) motionless. Surely, they are a host that are doomed to be drowned.’"
How many were the gardens and the springs that they left behind!
And the cornfields and the noble places!
And the comforts wherein they took delight!
Thus (it was destined to be). And We made another people inherit these things.
"And the heaven and the earth wept not for them, nor were they given a respite."
And We delivered the children of Israel from the abasing torment
 (Inflicted) by Pharaoh; he was surely haughty (even) among the extravagant.
And We chose them knowingly above the peoples (of their time).
And We gave them some Signs wherein was a clear trial.
These (people) do say:
"‘It is but our first (and only) death, (after which there is no life) and we shall not be raised again."
"‘So bring (back) our fathers, if you speak the truth.’"
Are they better or the people of Tubba‘ and those before them? We destroyed them because they were sinful.
"And We created not the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, in sport."
"We created them not but with the requirements of truth (and justice), but most of them understand not."
"Verily, the Day of Decision is the appointed time for all of them,"
"The Day when a friend shall not avail a friend at all, nor shall they be helped,"
"Save those to whom Allah shows mercy. Surely, He is the Mighty, the Merciful."
"Verily, the tree of Zaqqum"
"Will be the food of the sinful,"
"Like molten copper, it will boil in (their) bellies,"
Like the boiling of scalding water.
‘Seize him and drag him into the midst of the blazing Fire;
‘Then pour upon his head the torment of boiling water.’
"‘Taste (it)! Thou (didst consider) thyself the mighty, the honourable."
‘This indeed is what you did doubt.’
"Verily, the righteous will be in a place of security,"
"And gardens and springs,"
"Attired in fine silk and heavy brocade, facing one another."
"Thus (will it be). And We shall consort them with fair maidens, having wide, (beautiful) eyes."
"They will call therein for every (kind of) fruit, in (peace and) security."
"They will not taste death therein, other than the first death. And He will save them from the punishment of the blazing Fire,"
 (As an act of) grace from thy Lord. That is the supreme triumph.
And We have made it (the Qur’an) easy in thy tongue that they may give heed.
So wait thou; they (too) are waiting.
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
Ha Mim.
"The revelation of this Book is from Allah, the Mighty, the Wise."
Verily in the heavens and the earth are Signs for those who believe.
And in your own creation and (in) that of all the creatures which He scatters (in the earth) are Signs for a people who possess firm faith.
"And (in) the alternation of night and day, and the provision that Allah sends down from the sky, whereby He quickens the earth after its death, and (in) the change of the winds, are Signs for a people who (try to) understand."
"These are the Signs of Allah which We rehearse unto thee with truth. In what word, then, after (rejecting that of) Allah and His Signs will they believe?"
"Woe to every sinful liar,"
"Who hears the Signs of Allah recited unto him, and then proudly persists (in his disbelief), as though he heard them not. So give him the tidings of a painful punishment."
"And when he learns something of Our Signs, he makes a jest of them. For such there is an abasing punishment."
"Before them is Hell; and that which they have earned shall not avail them aught, nor shall those whom they have taken for protectors beside Allah. And they will have a great punishment."
This is guidance. And for those who disbelieve in the Signs of their Lord is the torture of a painful punishment.
"Allah it is Who has subjected the sea to you that ships may sail thereon by His command, and that you may seek of His bounty, and that you may be grateful."
And He has subjected to you whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth: all (this is) from Him. In that surely are Signs for a people who reflect.
"Tell those who believe to forgive those who (persecute them and) fear not the Days of Allah, that He may requite a people for what they earn."
"Whoso does right, does it for his own soul; and whoso does wrong, does so to its detriment. Then to your Lord will you (all) be brought back."
"And verily, We gave the children of Israel the Book, and sovereignty, and prophethood; and We provided them with (good and) pure things, and We exalted them over the peoples (of the time)."
"And We gave them clear Signs regarding this affair. And they did not differ but after (true) knowledge had come to them, through mutual envy. Verily, thy Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they differed."
"Then We set thee on a clear path in the matter (of religion); so follow it, and follow not the evil inclinations of those who know not."
"Verily, they will not avail thee aught against Allah. And as for the wrongdoers, some of them are friends of others; but Allah is the Friend of the righteous."
This (Book contains) clear evidences for mankind and is a guidance and a mercy for a people who possess firm faith.
"Do those who commit evil deeds think that We shall make them like those who believe and do good works, so that their life and their death shall be equal? Evil (indeed) is what they judge."
And Allah has created the heavens and the earth with truth and that every soul may be requited for that which it earns; and they shall not be wronged.
"Hast thou seen him who conceives of his god according to his own fancy, and whom Allah has adjudged astray on basis of (His) knowledge, and whose ears and whose heart He has sealed up, and on whose eyes He has put a covering? Who, then, will guide him after Allah (has condemned him)? Will you not then heed?"
"And they say, ‘There is nothing but this our present life; we die and we live (here); and nothing but Time destroys us.’ But they have no knowledge of that; they do but conjecture."
"And when Our clear Signs are recited unto them, their only contention is that they say, ‘Bring (back) our fathers, if you are truthful.’"
"Say, ‘(It is) Allah (Who) gives you life, then causes you to die; then He will gather you together unto the Day of Resurrection about which there is no doubt. But most men know not.’"
"To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; and on the day when the Hour shall come, on that day those who follow falsehood will be the losers."
"And thou wilt see every people on (their) knees. Every people will be summoned to their record, (and it shall be said to them), ‘This day shall you be requited for that which you did."
‘This is Our Book; it speaks against you with truth. We caused (all) that you did to be (fully) recorded.’
"Now as for those who believed and did good works, their Lord will admit them into His mercy. That is the clear achievement."
"But as to those who disbelieved: “Were not My Signs recited unto you? But you were arrogant, and were a guilty people."
"“And when it was said, ‘The promise of Allah is certainly true, and (as to) the Hour, there is no doubt about its (coming),’ you said, ‘We know not what the Hour is; we think it to be nothing but a conjecture, and we are not convinced.’ ”"
"And the evil (consequences) of their deeds will become apparent to them, and that which they used to mock at shall encompass them."
"And it will be said (to them), ‘This day shall We forget you, as you forgot the meeting of this day of  yours. And your resort is the Fire, and you will have no helpers."
"‘This (is so), because you made a jest of the Signs of Allah, and the life of the world deceived you.’ Therefore, that day they will not be taken out from thence, nor will they be taken back into favour."
"All praise, then, belongs to Allah, Lord of the heavens, and Lord of the earth, the Lord of (all) the worlds."
"And His is the majesty in the heavens and the earth; and He is the Mighty, the Wise."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
Ha Mim.
"The revelation of this Book is from Allah, the Mighty, the Wise."
"We have not created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, but with truth, and for an appointed term; but those who disbelieve turn away from that of which they have been warned."
"Say, ‘Do you know what it is you call on beside Allah? Show me what they have created of the earth. Or have they a share in the (creation of the) heavens? Bring me a Book (revealed) before this or some vestige of knowledge (in your support), if you (indeed) speak the truth.’"
"And who is more astray than those who, instead of Allah, pray unto such as will not answer them till the Day of Resurrection, and they are even unconscious of their prayer?"
"And when mankind are gathered together they will become enemies to them, and will deny their worship."
"And when Our clear Signs are recited unto them, those who disbelieve say of the truth when it comes to them, ‘This is manifest sorcery.’"
"Do they say, ‘He has forged it?’ Say, ‘If I have forged it, you cannot avail me aught against Allah. He knows best what (mischievous) talk you indulge in. Sufficient is He for a  Witness between me and you. And He is the Most Forgiving, the Merciful.’"
"Say, ‘I am no new Messenger, nor do I know what will be done with me or with you (in this life). I do but follow what is revealed to me; and I am but a plain Warner.’"
"Say, ‘Tell me, if this is from Allah and you disbelieve therein, and a witness from among the children of Israel bears witness to (the advent of) one like him, and he believed, but you are too proud, (how should you fare)?’ Verily, Allah guides not the wrongdoing people."
"And those who disbelieve say of those who believe: ‘If it were any good, they could not have been ahead of us in attaining it.’ And since they have not been guided thereby, they will say, ‘This is an old lie.’"
"And before it there was the Book of Moses, a guide and a mercy; and this is a Book in the Arabic language fulfilling (previous prophecies), that it may warn those who do wrong; and as glad tidings to those who do good."
"Verily, those who say, ‘Our Lord is Allah,’ (and) then remain steadfast —  no fear (shall come) upon them, nor shall they grieve."
These are the dwellers of the Garden; they shall abide therein — a recompense for what they did.
"And We have enjoined on man to be good to his parents. His mother bears him with pain, and brings him forth with pain. And the bearing of him and his weaning takes thirty  months, till, when he attains his full maturity and reaches (the age of) forty years, he says, ‘My Lord, grant me (the power) that I may be grateful for Thy favour which Thou hast bestowed upon me and upon my parents, and that I may do such good works as may please Thee. And make my seed righteous for me. I do turn to Thee; and, truly, I am of those who submit (to Thee).’"
"Those are they from whom We accept their good works and overlook their ill deeds. (They shall be) among the inmates of the Garden, (in fulfilment of) the true promise which was made to them."
"But the one who says to his parents, ‘Fie on you both! do you threaten me that I shall be brought forth (again), when generations have already passed away before me?’ And they both cry unto Allah for help (and say to him): ‘Woe unto thee! believe; for the promise of Allah is true.’ But he says, ‘This is nothing but the fables of the ancients.’"
"These are they against whom the sentence (of punishment) became due, along with the communities of the Jinn and mankind that had gone before them. Indeed, they were the losers."
"And for all are degrees (of rank) according to what they did, and that Allah may fully repay them for their deeds; and they shall not be wronged."
"And on the day when those who disbelieve will be brought before the Fire, (it will be said to them), ‘You exhausted your good things in the life of the world, and you (fully) enjoyed them. Now this day you shall be requited with ignominious  punishment because you were arrogant in the earth without justification, and because you acted rebelliously.’"
"And make mention of the brother of ‘Ad, when he warned his people among the sand-hills — and Warners there have been before him and after him — (saying), ‘Worship none but Allah. I fear for you the punishment of a great day.’"
"They said, ‘Hast thou come to us to turn us away from our gods? Bring us then that with which thou dost threaten us, if (indeed) thou art of the truthful.’"
"He said, ‘The knowledge (thereof) is only with Allah. And I convey to you what I have been sent with, but I see you to be a (very) ignorant people.’"
"Then, when they saw it coming towards their valleys as a cloud, they said, ‘This is a cloud which will give us rain.’ ‘Nay, but it is that which you sought to hasten — a wind wherein is a grievous punishment."
"‘It will destroy everything by the command of its Lord.’ And they became such that there was nothing left to be seen, except their dwellings. Thus do We requite the guilty people."
And We had established them in what We have established you not; and We gave them ears and eyes and hearts. But their ears and their eyes and their hearts availed them naught since they denied the Signs of Allah; and that at which they used to mock encompassed them.
"And We did destroy townships round about you; and We have varied the Signs, that they might turn (to Us)."
"Why, then, did not those help them whom they had taken for gods beside Allah, seeking (His) nearness (through them)? Nay, they were lost to them. That was (the result of) their lie, and of what they fabricated."
"And (remember) when We turned towards thee a party of the Jinn who wished to hear the Qur’an and, when they were present at its (recitation), they said (to one another), ‘Be silent (and listen),’ and, when it was finished, they went back to their people, warning (them)."
"They said, ‘O our people, we have heard a Book, which has been sent down after Moses, fulfilling that which is before it; it guides to the truth, and to the right path."
"‘O our people, respond to Allah’s Summoner and believe in Him. He will forgive you your sins, and protect you from a painful punishment."
"‘And whoso does not respond to Allah’s Summoner, he cannot escape (Him) in the earth, nor can he have any protector beside Him. Such are in manifest error.’"
"Have they not seen that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth and was not wearied by their creation, has the power to give life to the dead? Yea, verily, He has power over all things."
"And on the day when those who disbelieve will be brought before the Fire, (it will be said to them), ‘Is not this the truth?’ They will say,  ‘Aye, by our Lord.’ He will say, ‘Then taste the punishment, because you disbelieved.’"
"Have patience, then, as had the Messengers of strong determination; and be in no haste about them. On the day when they see that with which they are threatened, it will appear to them as though they had not tarried save for an hour of a day. (This warning) has been conveyed; and none but the disobedient people shall be destroyed."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
Those who disbelieve and hinder (men) from the way of Allah — He renders their works vain.
But (as for) those who believe and do good works and believe in that which has been revealed to Muhammad  —  and it is the truth from their Lord  —  He removes from them their sins and improves their condition.
That is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood while those who believe follow the truth from their Lord. Thus does Allah set forth for men their similitudes.
"And when you meet (in regular battle) those who disbelieve, smite (their) necks; and, when you have overcome them, bind fast the fetters — then afterwards either (release them as a) favour or (by taking) ransom — until the war lays down its burdens. That (is the ordinance). And if Allah had (so) pleased, He could have punished them (Himself), but (He has willed) that He may try some of you by others. And those who are killed in the way of Allah — He will never render their works vain."
"He will guide them and improve their condition,"
And admit them into the Garden which He has made known to them.
"O ye who believe! if you help (the cause of) Allah, He will help you and will make your steps firm."
"But (as for) those who disbelieve, perdition is their (lot); and He will make their works vain."
That is because they hate what Allah has revealed; so He has made their works futile.
"Have they not travelled in the earth and seen what was the end of those who were before them? Allah (utterly) destroyed them, and for the disbelievers there will be the like thereof."
"That is because Allah is the Protector of those who believe, and as for the disbelievers, there is no protector for them."
"Verily, Allah will make those who believe and do good works enter the Gardens underneath which rivers flow; while those who disbelieve enjoy themselves and eat even as the cattle eat, and the Fire will be their resort."
"And how many a township, more powerful than thy town which has driven thee out, have We destroyed, and they had no helper!"
Is he then who stands upon a clear proof from his Lord like those to whom the evil of their deeds is made (to look) beautiful and who follow their evil inclinations?
"A description of the Garden promised to the righteous: therein are rivers of water which corrupts not; and rivers of milk of which the taste changes not; and rivers of wine, a delight to those who drink, and rivers of clarified honey. And in it will they have all (kinds of) fruit,  and forgiveness from their Lord. Can (those who enjoy such bliss) be like those who abide in the Fire and who are given boiling water to drink so that it tears their bowels?"
"And among them are some who listen to thee till, when they go forth from thy presence, they say to those who have been given knowledge, ‘What has he been talking about just now?’ These are they whose hearts Allah has sealed, and who follow their own evil inclinations."
"But (as for) those who follow guidance, He adds to their guidance, and bestows on them their righteousness."
"They wait not but for the Hour, that it should come upon them suddenly. The signs thereof have already come. But (of) what (avail) will their admonition be to them when it has (actually) come upon them?"
"Know, therefore, that there is no God other than Allah, and ask forgiveness for thy frailties, and for believing men and believing women. And Allah knows the place where you move about and the place where you stay."
"And those who believe say, ‘Why is not a Surah revealed?’ But when a decisive Surah is revealed and fighting is mentioned therein, thou seest those in whose hearts is a disease looking towards thee with the look of one who is fainting on account of (approaching) death. So ruin seize them!"
"Obedience and a kind word (is better for them). And when the matter is determined upon, it is good  for them if they were true to Allah."
"Would you then, if you are placed in authority, create disorder in the land and sever your ties of kinship?"
It is these whom Allah curses so that He makes them deaf and makes their eyes blind.
"Will they not, then, ponder over the Qur’an, or is it that on the hearts are their locks?"
"Surely, those who turn their backs after guidance has become manifest to them, Satan has seduced them, and holds out to them false hopes."
"That is because they said to those who hate what Allah has revealed, ‘We will obey you in some matters;’ and Allah knows their secrets."
"But how (will they fare) when the angels will cause them to die, smiting their faces and their backs?"
"This is because they followed that which displeased Allah, and hated that which pleased Him. So He rendered their works vain."
Do those in whose hearts is a disease suppose that Allah will not bring to light their malice?
"And if We pleased, We could show them to thee so that thou shouldst know them by their marks. And thou shalt surely recognize them by the tone of (their) speech. And Allah knows your deeds."
And We will surely try you until We distinguish those among you who strive (for the cause of God) and  those who are steadfast. And We will make known the facts about you.
"Those who disbelieve and hinder (men) from the way of Allah and oppose the Messenger after guidance has become manifest to them, shall not harm Allah in the least; and He will make their works fruitless."
O ye who believe! obey Allah and obey the Messenger and let not your works go vain.
"Verily, those who disbelieve and hinder (men) from the way of Allah, (and) then die while they are disbelievers —  Allah certainly will not forgive them."
"So be not slack and sue not for peace; for you will (certainly) have the upper hand. And Allah is with you, and He will not deprive you of (the reward of) your actions."
"The life of (this) world is but a sport and a pastime, and if you believe and be righteous, He will give you your rewards, and will not ask of you your possessions."
"If He ask them of you, and press you, you would be niggardly, and He would bring to light your malice."
"Behold, you are those who are called upon to spend in the way of Allah; but of you there are some who are niggardly. And whoso is niggardly, is niggardly only against his own soul. And Allah is Self- Sufficient, and it is you that are needy. And if you turn your backs, He will bring in your stead a people other than you, then they will not be like you."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"Verily, We have granted thee a clear victory,"
"That Allah may cover up for thee thy shortcomings, past and future, and that He may complete His favour upon thee, and may guide thee on a right path;"
And that Allah may help thee with a mighty help.
"He it is Who sent down tranquillity into the hearts of the believers that they might add faith to their faith — and to Allah belong the hosts of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is All-knowing, Wise — "
"That He may make the believing men and the believing women enter the Gardens beneath which streams flow, wherein they will abide, and (that) He may remove their evils from them — and that, in the sight of Allah, is the supreme triumph — "
"And (that) He may punish the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women, and the idolatrous men and the idolatrous women, who entertain evil thoughts concerning Allah. On them (shall fall) an evil calamity; and the wrath of Allah is upon them. And He has cursed them, and has prepared Hell for them. And that indeed is an evil destination."
"And to Allah belong the hosts of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Mighty, Wise."
"We have sent thee as a Witness and a bearer of glad tidings and a Warner,"
"That you should believe in Allah and His Messenger, and may help him, and honour him, and (that) you may glorify Him morning and evening."
"Verily, those who swear allegiance to thee indeed swear allegiance to Allah. The hand of Allah is over their hands. So whoever breaks (his oath), breaks (it) to his own loss; and whoever fulfils the covenant that he has made with Allah, He will surely give him a great reward."
"Those of the desert Arabs, who were left behind, will say to thee, ‘Our possessions and our families kept us occupied, so ask forgiveness for us.’ They say with their tongues that which is not in their hearts. Say, ‘Who can avail you aught against Allah, if He intends you some harm, or if He intends you some benefit? Nay, Allah is Well-Aware of what you do."
"‘Nay, you thought that the Messenger and the believers would never come back to their families, and that was made (to appear) pleasing to your hearts, and you thought an evil thought, and you were a ruined people.’"
And (as for) those who believe not in Allah and His Messenger —  We have surely prepared for the disbelievers a blazing fire.
"And to Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He forgives whom He pleases, and punishes whom He pleases. And Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"Those (who had managed to be) left behind will say, when you go forth to the spoils that you may get them, ‘Let us follow you.’ They seek to change the decree of Allah. Say, ‘You shall not follow us. Thus has Allah said beforehand.’ Then they will say, ‘Nay, but you envy us.’ Not so, but they understand not except a little."
"Say to the desert Arabs who were left behind, ‘You shall be called (to fight) against a people of mighty valour; you shall fight them until they surrender. Then, if you obey, Allah will give you a good reward, but if you turn your backs, as you turned your backs before, He will punish you with a painful punishment.’"
"There is no blame on the blind, nor is there blame on the lame, nor is there blame on the sick, (if they go not forth for fight). And whoso obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will make him enter the Gardens beneath which streams flow; but whoso turns his back, him will He punish with a grievous punishment."
"Surely, Allah was well pleased with the believers when they were swearing allegiance to thee under the Tree, and He knew what was in their hearts, and He sent down tranquillity on them, and He rewarded them with a victory near at hand;"
"And great spoils that they will take. And Allah is Mighty, Wise."
"Allah has promised you great spoils that you will take, and He has given you this in advance, and has restrained the hands of men from you, that it may be a Sign for the believers, and that He may guide  you on a right path."
"And (He has promised you) another (victory), which you have not yet been able to achieve, (but) Allah has surely compassed it. And Allah has power over all things."
"And if those who disbelieve should fight you, they would certainly turn their backs; then they would find neither protector nor helper."
Such is the law of Allah that has been (in operation) before; and thou shalt not find any change in the law of Allah.
"And He it is Who withheld their hands from you and your hands from them in the valley of Mecca, after He had given you victory over them. And Allah sees all that you do."
"It is they who disbelieved and hindered you from the Sacred Mosque and the offering which was prevented from reaching its place of sacrifice. And had it not been for believing men and believing women whom you knew not and whom you might have trampled down so that harm might have come to you on their account unknowingly, (He would have permitted you to fight), (but He did not do so) that He might admit into His mercy whom He will. If they had been separated (from the disbelievers), We would have surely punished those of them who disbelieved with a grievous punishment."
"When those who disbelieved harboured in their hearts prideful indignation, the indignation (of the Days) of Ignorance, Allah sent down His tranquillity on His Messenger  and on the believers, and made them cleave to the principle of righteousness, and they were better entitled to it and more worthy of it. And Allah knows everything full well."
"Surely has Allah in truth fulfilled for His Messenger the Vision. You will certainly enter the Sacred Mosque, if Allah will, in security, (some) having (their) heads shaven, and (others) having (their) hair cut short; (and) you will have no fear. But He knew what you knew not. He has in fact ordained for you, besides that, a victory near at hand."
"He it is Who has sent His Messenger, with guidance and the Religion of truth, that He may make it prevail over (all other) religions. And sufficient is Allah as a Witness."
"Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. And those who are with him are hard against the disbelievers, tender among themselves. Thou seest them bowing (and) prostrating themselves (in Prayer), seeking grace from Allah and (His) pleasure. Their mark is upon their faces, being the traces of prostrations. This is their description in the Torah. And their description in the Gospel is like unto a seed-produce that sends forth its sprout, then makes it strong; it then becomes thick, and stands firm on its stem, delighting the sowers —  that He may cause the disbelievers to burn with rage (at the sight) of them. Allah has promised, unto those of them who believe and do good works, forgiveness and a great reward."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"O ye who believe! be not forward in the presence of Allah and His Messenger, but fear Allah. Verily, Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
"O ye who believe! raise not your voices above the voice of the Prophet, and speak not aloud to him, as you speak aloud to one another, lest your works become vain while you perceive not."
Verily those who lower their voices in the presence of the Messenger of Allah are the ones whose hearts Allah has purified for righteousness. For them is forgiveness and a great reward.
Those who shout out to thee from without (thy private) apartments —  most of them lack understanding.
"And if they had waited patiently until thou came out to them, it would be better for them. But Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"O ye who believe! if an unrighteous person brings you any news, ascertain (the correctness of the report) fully, lest you harm a people in ignorance, and then become repentant for what you have done."
"And know that among you is the Messenger of Allah; if he were to comply with your wishes in most of the matters, you would surely come to trouble; but Allah has endeared the faith to you and has made it (look) beautiful to your hearts, and He has made disbelief, wickedness and disobedience hateful to you. Such indeed are those who follow the right course,"
"Through the grace and favour of Allah. And Allah is All-Knowing, Wise."
"And if two parties of believers fight (against each other), make peace between them; then if (after that) one of them transgresses against the other, fight the party that transgresses until it returns to the command of Allah. Then if it returns, make peace between them with equity, and act justly. Verily, Allah loves the just."
"Surely (all) believers are brothers. So make peace between brothers, and fear Allah that mercy may be shown to you."
"O ye who believe! let not one people deride (another) people, who may be better than they, nor let women (deride other) women, who may be better than they. And defame not your own people, nor call (one another) by nicknames. Bad (indeed) is evil reputation after (the profession of) belief; and those who repent not are the wrongdoers."
"O ye who believe! avoid most of suspicions; for suspicion in some cases is a sin. And spy not, nor  back-bite one another. Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his brother who is dead? Certainly you would loathe it. And fear Allah, surely, Allah is Oft-Returning (with compassion and) is Merciful."
"O mankind, We have created you from a male and a female; and We have made you into tribes and sub-tribes that you may recognize one another. Verily, the most honourable among you, in the sight of Allah, is he who is the most righteous among you. Surely, Allah is All-knowing, All-Aware."
"The Arabs of the desert say, ‘We believe.’ Say, “You have not believed (yet); but rather say, ‘We have accepted Islam,’ for the (true) belief has not yet entered into your hearts.” But if you obey Allah and His Messenger, He will not detract anything from your deeds Surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"The believers are only those who (truly) believe in Allah and His Messenger, and then doubt not, but strive with their possessions and their persons in the cause of Allah. It is they who are truthful."
"Say, ‘Will you acquaint Allah with your faith, while Allah knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and Allah knows all things full well?’"
"They think they have done thee a favour by their embracing Islam. Say, ‘Deem not your embracing  Islam a favour unto me. On the contrary, Allah has bestowed a favour upon you in that He has guided you to the (true) Faith, if you are truthful.’"
"Verily, Allah knows the secrets of the heavens and the earth. And Allah sees all that you do."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"Qaf. By the glorious Qur’an, (thou art a Messenger of God)."
"But they wonder that there has come to them a Warner from among themselves. And the disbelievers say, ‘This is a strange thing!"
"‘What! when we are dead and have become dust, (shall we be raised to life again)? That is a return far (from possible).’"
We know how much the earth diminishes of them and with Us is a Book that preserves (everything).
"Nay, they rejected the truth when it came to them, and so they are in a state of confusion."
"Have they not looked at the sky above them, how We have made it and adorned it, and there are no flaws in it?"
"And the earth — We have spread it out, and placed therein firm mountains; and We have made to grow therein every (kind of) beautiful species,"
As (a means of) enlightenment and as a reminder to every servant that turns (to God).
"And We send down from the sky water which is full of blessings, and We produce therewith gardens and grain harvests,"
"And tall palm-trees, with spathes piled one above the other,"
As a provision for (Our) servants; and We quicken thereby a dead land. Even so shall be the Resurrection.
"The people of Noah rejected (the truth) before them and (so did) the People of the Well, and Thamud,"
"And ‘Ad, and Pharaoh and the brethren of Lot,"
"And the Dwellers of the Wood, and the people of Tubba‘. All (of them) rejected the Messengers with the result that My threatened punishment befell (them)."
"Have We then become weary with the first creation? Nay, but they are in confusion about the new creation."
"And assuredly, We have created man and We know what his (physical) self whispers (to him), and We are nearer to him than (even his) jugular vein."
"When the two Recording (angels) record (the deeds of men), (one) sitting on the right and (the other) on the left,"
He utters not a word but there is by him a guardian (angel) ready (to record it).
And the stupor of death certainly comes. ‘This is what thou wast trying to run from.’
And the trumpet shall be blown: ‘This is the Day of Promise.’
And every soul shall come forth (and) along with it there will be an (angel) to drive and an (angel) to bear witness.
"‘Thou wast heedless of this; now We have removed from thee thy veil, and sharp is thy sight this day.’"
"And his companion will say, ‘This is what I have (of the record) ready."
"‘Cast ye twain into Hell every ungrateful enemy (of truth),"
"‘Hinderer of good, transgressor, doubter,"
‘Who sets up another God beside Allah. So do ye twain cast him into the dreadful torment.’
"His associate will say, ‘O our Lord, I did not cause him to rebel; but he (himself) was too far gone in error.’"
" (God) will say, ‘Quarrel not in My presence, I gave you the warning beforehand."
"‘The sentence (passed) by Me cannot be changed, and I am not at all unjust to (My) servants.’"
"On that day We will say to Hell, ‘Art thou filled up?’, and it will answer, ‘Is there more?’"
"And Heaven will be brought near to the righteous, no longer remote."
"‘This is what was promised to you — to everyone who always turned (to God) and was watchful (of his actions),"
‘Who feared the Gracious (God) in private and came (to Him) with a penitent heart.
‘Enter ye therein in peace. This is the Day of Eternity.’
"They will have therein whatever they desire, and with Us is (a good deal) more."
"And how many a generation who were greater than they in power have We destroyed before them! (But when the punishment came), they went about the lands. Was there any place of refuge (for them)?"
"Therein, verily, is a reminder for him who has a heart, or who gives ear, and is attentive."
"And verily, We created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six periods, and no weariness touched Us."
"So bear with patience what they say, and glorify thy Lord with (His) praise, before the rising of the sun and before (its) setting;"
"And in (a part of) the night (also) do thou glorify Him, and after (prescribed) prostrations."
"And listen! The day when the crier will cry from a place nearby,"
The day when they will hear the blast in truth; that will be the day of coming forth (from the graves).
"Verily, it is We Who give life and cause death, and to Us is the (final) return."
" (On) the day when the earth will cleave asunder from over them (and they will come forth) hastening —  that will be a gathering together, quite easy for Us."
"We know best what they say; and thou hast not been (appointed) to compel them (in any way). So admonish, by means of the Qur’an, him who fears My warning."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"By (the winds) that scatter (seeds with a true) scattering,"
"Then by (the clouds) that carry the load (of moisture),"
"Then by (the rivers) that flow gently,"
" (And) then by (the angels) that finally administer and execute affairs,"
"Surely, that which you are promised is true;"
And the Judgment will surely come to pass.
"And by the heaven (full) of tracks,"
Truly you are discordant in (your) utterances.
He (alone) is turned away from (the truth) who is (destined to be thus) turned away.
"Cursed be the liars,"
Who are heedless in the depth (of ignorance).
They ask: ‘When will be the Day of Judgment?’
 (It will be) the day when they will be tormented at the Fire.
‘Taste ye your torment. This is what you would hasten.’
" (But) surely the righteous will be in the midst of gardens and springs,"
Receiving what their Lord will give them; for they used to do good before that.
They used to sleep but a little of the night;
And at the dawn of the day they sought forgiveness;
And in their wealth was a share for one who asked for help and (for) one who could not.
"And in the earth are Signs for those who have certainty of faith,"
And (also) in your own selves. Will you not then see?
"And in heaven is your sustenance, and (also) that which you are promised."
"And by the Lord of the heaven and the earth, it is certainly the truth, even as (it is true that) you speak."
Has the story of Abraham’s honoured guests reached thee?
"When they entered upon him and said, ‘Peace!’ he said, ‘Peace!’ (They were) all strangers."
"And he went quietly to his household, and brought a fatted calf,"
"And he placed it before them. He said, ‘Will you not eat?’"
"And he felt a fear on account of them. They said, ‘Fear not.’ And they gave him glad tidings of (the birth of) a son possessing knowledge."
"Then his wife came forward crying and smote her face and said, ‘A barren old woman!’"
"They said, ‘Even so has thy Lord said. Surely, He is the Wise, the All- Knowing.’"
" (Abraham) said, ‘Now what is your errand, O ye messengers?’"
"They said, ‘We have been sent to a sinful people,"
"‘That we may send down upon them stones of clay,"
"‘Marked, with thy Lord, for those guilty of excesses.’"
"And We brought forth therefrom such of the believers as were there,"
And We found not there except only one house of Muslims.
And We left therein a Sign for those who fear the painful punishment.
"And (We left another Sign) in Moses when We sent him to Pharaoh with clear authority,"
"But he turned away (from Moses) in his (pride of) power, and said, ‘A sorcerer, or a madman.’"
So We seized him and his hosts and threw them into the sea; and he (himself) was to blame.
"And (there was a Sign) in (the tribe of) ‘Ad, when We sent against them the destructive wind."
"It left nothing whatever that it visited, but made it like a rotten bone."
"And (a Sign there was) in (the tribe of) Thamud when it was said to them, ‘Enjoy yourselves for a while.’"
But they rebelled against the command of their Lord. So the thunderbolt overtook them while they gazed;
"And they were not able to rise (again), nor could they defend themselves."
And (We destroyed) the people of Noah before (them); they were a disobedient people.
"And We have built the heaven with (Our own) hands, and verily We have vast powers."
"And the earth We have spread out, and (how) excellently do We prepare (things)!"
"And of everything have We created pairs, that you may reflect."
"Flee ye therefore unto Allah. Surely, I am a plain Warner unto you from Him."
"And do not set up another God along with Allah. Surely, I am a plain Warner unto you from Him."
"Even so there came no Messenger to those before them, but they said, ‘A sorcerer, or a madman!’"
"Have they made it a legacy to one another? Nay, they are (all) a rebellious people."
So turn away from them; and there will be no blame on thee.
"And keep on exhorting; for verily, exhortation benefits those who would believe."
And I have not created the Jinn and the men but that they may worship Me.
"I desire no sustenance from them, nor do I desire that they should feed Me."
"Surely, it is Allah (Himself) Who is the Great Sustainer, the Powerful, the Strong."
And for those who do wrong there is a share (of comfort) like the share (enjoyed by) their fellows (of the earlier times); so let them not ask Me to hasten on (the punishment).
"Woe, then, to those who disbelieve, because of that day of theirs which they have been promised!"
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
By the Mount;
And (by) the Book inscribed
On parchment unfolded;
And (by) the frequented House;
And (by) the elevated Roof;
And (by) the swollen sea;
The punishment of thy Lord shall certainly come to pass;
There is none that can avert it.
"On the day when the heaven will heave (with awful) heaving,"
"And the mountains will move, (with terrible) moving,"
"Then woe that day to those who reject the truth,"
Who sportingly indulge in idle talk.
The day when they shall be thrust into the fire of Hell (with a violent) thrust.
‘This is the Fire which you treated as a lie.
"‘Is this then magic, or do you not see?"
"‘Burn ye therein; and whether you show patience or you show (it) not, it will be the same for you. You are requited (only) for what you used to do.’"
"Verily, the righteous are in Gardens and in bliss,"
Enjoying what their Lord has bestowed on them; and their Lord has saved them from the torment of the Fire.
"‘Eat and drink in happiness because of what you used to do,"
"‘Reclining on couches arranged in rows.’ And We shall consort them with fair maidens having wide, (beautiful) eyes."
And those who believe and whose children follow them in faith — with them shall We join their children. And We will not diminish anything from (the reward of) their works. Every man stands pledged for what he has earned.
And We shall bestow upon them (an abundance of) fruit and meat such as they will wish for.
There they will pass from one to another a cup wherein is neither levity nor sin.
"And there will wait upon them youths of their own, as though they were pearls well-preserved."
"And they will turn to one another, asking mutual questions."
"They will say, ‘Before this, when (we were) among our family, we were very much afraid (of God)’(s displeasure);"
‘But Allah has been gracious unto us and has saved us from the torment of the burning blast.
"‘We used to pray to Him before. Surely, He is the Beneficent, the Merciful.’"
"Admonish then. By the grace of thy Lord, thou art neither a soothsayer, nor a madman."
"Do they say, ‘(He is) a poet; we are waiting for some calamity which time will bring upon him?’"
"Say, ‘Await ye then! I (too) am with you among those who are waiting.’"
Do their intellect (and reason) enjoin this upon them or are they a rebellious people?
"Do they say, ‘He has fabricated it?’ Nay, but they would not believe."
"Let them, then, bring forth an announcement like this, if they speak the truth!"
"Have they been created for nothing, or are they themselves the creators?"
"Did they create the heavens and the earth? Nay, but they have no faith."
"Do they own the treasures of thy Lord, or are they the guardians (thereof) ?"
Have they a ladder (unto heaven) by means of which they can overhear? Then let their listener bring a manifest authority.
Has He daughters and you have sons?
"Dost thou ask a reward from them, so that they are weighed down with a load of debt?"
"Do they possess (knowledge of) the unseen, so that they write (it) down?"
Do they intend a plot? But it is those who disbelieve that will be caught in the plot.
Have they a God other than Allah? Exalted is Allah above (all) that which they associate (with Him)!
"And if they should see a piece of the cloud falling down, they would say, ‘Clouds piled up.’"
"So leave them until they meet that day of theirs, on which they will be overtaken by a thunderbolt,"
"The day when their plotting will not avail them aught, nor shall they be helped."
"And verily, for those who do wrong there is a punishment besides that. But most of them know not."
So wait patiently for the judgment of thy Lord; for assuredly thou art before Our eyes; and glorify thy Lord with (His) praise when thou risest up (from sleep);
And for part of the night (also) do thou glorify Him and at the setting of the stars.
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"By the stemless plant when it falls,"
"Your companion has neither erred, nor has he gone astray,"
Nor does he speak out of (his own) desire.
It is nothing but (pure) revelation (that has been) revealed (by God).
" (The Lord) of mighty powers has taught him,"
" (The One) Possessor of strength. So He manifested His ascendance (over everything),"
"And (He revealed His Word) when he was on the uppermost horizon,"
"Then he drew nearer (to God); then he came down (to mankind),"
"So that he became, (as it were), one chord to two bows or closer still."
Then He revealed to His servant that which He revealed.
The heart (of the Prophet) was not untrue to that which he saw.
Will you then dispute with him about what he saw?
"And certainly, he saw Him a second time (also),"
"Near the farthest Lote-tree,"
Near which is the Garden of Eternal Abode.
 (This was) when that which covers covered the Lote-tree.
"The eye deviated not, nor did (it) wander."
"Surely, he saw the greatest of the Signs of his Lord."
"Now tell (me) about Lat and ‘Uzza,"
"And Manat, the third one, another (goddess)!"
‘What! for you the males and for Him the females!’
That indeed is an unfair division.
"‘These are but names which you have named — you and your fathers — for which Allah has sent down no authority.’ They follow naught but conjecture and what their souls desire, while there has already come to them guidance from their Lord."
Can man have whatever he desires?
"Nay, to Allah belong the Hereafter and this (world)."
"And how many an angel is there in the heavens, but their intercession shall be of no avail, except after Allah has given permission to whomsoever He wills and pleases."
Those who believe not in the Hereafter name the angels with names of females;
But they have no knowledge thereof. They follow nothing but conjecture; and conjecture avails naught against truth.
"So turn aside from him who turns away from Our remembrance, and seeks nothing but the life of this world."
"That is the utmost limit of their knowledge. Verily, thy Lord knows him best who strays from His way, and He knows him best who follows guidance."
"And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, that He may requite those who do evil for what they have wrought, and that He may reward with what is best those who do good."
"Those who shun the grave sins and immoral actions except minor faults — verily, thy Lord is very liberal in forgiving. He knows you full well (from the time) when He created you from the earth, and when you were embryos in the bellies of your mothers. So ascribe not purity to yourselves. He knows him best who is (truly) righteous."
"Dost thou see him who turns away,"
"And gives a little, and does it grudgingly?"
Has he the knowledge of the unseen so that he can see?
Has he not been informed of what is in the Scriptures of Moses
And (of) Abraham who fulfilled (the commandments)? — 
That no bearer of burden shall bear the burden of another;
And that man will have nothing but what he strives for;
And that his striving shall soon be seen;
Then will he be rewarded for it with the fullest reward;
And that to thy Lord do (all things) ultimately go;
And that it is He Who makes (men) laugh and makes (them) weep;
And that it is He Who causes death and gives life;
"And that He creates the pairs, male and female,"
From a sperm-drop when it is poured forth;
And that it is for Him to bring forth the second creation;
And that it is He Who enriches and grants wealth to (one)’(s) satisfaction;
And that He is the Lord of Sirius;
"And that He destroyed the first (tribe of) ‘Ad,"
"And (the tribe of) Thamud, and He spared not (any of them),"
"And (He destroyed) the people of Noah before (them) — verily, they were most unjust and most rebellious — "
"And He overthrew the subverted cities (of the people of Lot),"
So that there covered them that which was to cover.
"Which then, (O man), of the bounties of thy Lord wilt thou dispute?"
This is a Warner from among the (class of the) Warners of old.
" (The Hour) that was to come has come nigh,"
None but Allah can avert it.
Do you then wonder at this announcement?
"And do you laugh, and weep not?"
And will you remain proudly heedless?
"So prostrate yourselves before Allah, and worship (Him)."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"The Hour has drawn nigh, and the moon is rent asunder."
"And if they see a Sign, they turn away and say, ‘A passing (feat of) magic.’"
They reject (the truth) and follow their own fancies. But every decree (of God) shall certainly come to pass.
And there has already come to them the great news wherein is a warning — 
Consummate wisdom; but the warnings profit them not.
"Therefore turn thou away from them. The day when the Summoner will summon (them) to a disagreeable thing,"
"While their eyes will be cast down and they will come forth from (their) graves as though they were locusts scattered about,"
"Hastening towards the Summoner. The disbelievers will say, ‘This is a hard day.’"
"The people of Noah rejected (the truth) before them; aye, they rejected Our servant and said, ‘A madman and one who is spurned.’"
"He therefore prayed to his Lord (saying), ‘I am overcome, so (come) Thou (to my) help!’"
"Thereupon We opened the gates of heaven, with water pouring down;"
"And We caused the earth to burst forth with springs, so the (two) waters met for a purpose that was decreed."
And We carried him upon that (which was made) of planks and nails.
It floated on under Our eyes: a reward for him who had been rejected.
And We left it as a Sign (for the coming generations); but is there anyone who would receive admonition?
How (terrible) then was My punishment and My warning!
And indeed We have made the Qur’an easy (to understand and) to remember. But is there anyone who would receive admonition?
 (The tribe of) ‘Ad rejected (the truth). How (terrible) then was My punishment and My warning!
"We sent against them a furious wind on a day of unending ill luck,"
Tearing people away as though they were the trunks of uprooted palm-trees.
How (terrible) then was My punishment and My warning!
And indeed We have made the Qur’an easy (to understand and) to remember. But is there anyone who would receive admonition?
 (The tribe of) Thamud (also) rejected the Warners.
"And they said, ‘What! a man, from among ourselves, a single individual! Shall we follow him? Then indeed we would be in manifest error, and (would be) mad."
"‘Has the Reminder been revealed to him (alone) of all of us? Nay, he is a boastful liar.’"
‘Tomorrow will they know who is the boastful liar!
"‘We will send the she-camel as a trial for them. So watch them, (O Salih), and have patience."
"‘And tell them that the water is shared (only) between them, (but as for the she-camel) every drinking time may be attended (by her).’"
"But they called their comrade, and he seized (a sword) and hamstrung (her)."
How (terrible) then was My punishment and My warning!
"We sent against them a single blast, and they became like the dry stubble, trampled upon."
And indeed We have made the Qur’an easy (to understand and) to remember. But is there anyone who would receive admonition?
Lot’s people (also) rejected the Warners.
"We sent a storm of stones upon them except the family of Lot, whom We delivered by early dawn,"
As a favour from Us. Thus do We reward him who is grateful.
"And he indeed had warned them of Our punishment, but they doubted the warning."
"And they (deceitfully) sought to turn him away from his guests. So We blinded their eyes, (and said), ‘Taste ye now My punishment and My warning.’"
And there came upon them early in the morning a lasting punishment.
‘Now taste ye My punishment and My warning.’
"And, indeed, We have made the Qur’an easy (to understand and) to remember. But is there anyone who would receive admonition?"
And surely to the people of Pharaoh (also) came Warners.
They rejected all Our Signs. So We seized them like the seizing of One Who is Mighty (and) Omnipotent.
Are your disbelievers better than those? Or have you an exemption in the Scriptures?
"Do they say, ‘We are a victorious host?’"
The hosts shall soon be routed and will turn their backs (in flight).
"Aye, the Hour is their appointed time; and the Hour will be most calamitous and most bitter."
"Surely, the guilty are in (manifest) error and gone mad."
"On the day when they will be dragged into the Fire on their faces, (and it will be said to them), ‘Taste ye the touch of Hell.’"
"Verily, We have created everything in (due) measure."
"And Our command is (carried out by) only one (word), like the twinkling of an eye."
And indeed We have destroyed people (before you who were) like unto you. But is there anyone who would receive admonition?
And everything they have done is (recorded) in the Books.
"And every matter, small and great, is written down."
"Verily, the righteous will be in the midst of Gardens and streams,"
In the seat of truth with an Omnipotent King.
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
" (It is God), the Gracious"
Who has taught the Qur’an.
He has created man.
He has taught him plain speech.
The sun and the moon (run their courses) according to a fixed reckoning.
And the stemless plants and the trees (humbly) submit (to His will).
"And the heaven He has raised high and set up a measure,"
That you may not transgress the measure.
So weigh all things in justice and fall not short of the measure.
And He has set the earth for (His) creatures;
"Therein are (all kinds of) fruit and palm-trees with sheaths,"
And grain with (its) husk and fragrant plants.
"Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will you twain deny, (O men and Jinn)?"
He created man from dry ringing clay (which is) like baked pottery.
And the Jinn He created from the flame of fire.
"Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will you twain deny?"
The Lord of the two Easts and the Lord of the two Wests!
"Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will you twain deny?"
He has made the two bodies of water flow. They will (one day) meet.
Between them is (now) a barrier; they encroach not (one upon the other).
"Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will you twain deny?"
There come out from them pearls and coral.
"Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will you twain deny?"
And His are the lofty ships reared aloft on the sea like mountains.
"Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will you twain deny?"
All that is on it (earth) will pass away.
"And there will remain (only) the Person of thy Lord, Master of Glory and Honour."
"Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will you twain deny?"
Of Him do beg all that are in the heavens and the earth. Every day He (reveals Himself) in a different state.
"Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will you twain deny?"
"Soon shall We attend to you, O ye two big groups!"
"Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will you twain deny?"
"O company of Jinn and men! if you have power to go beyond the confines of the heavens and the earth, then do go. But you cannot go save with authority."
"Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will you twain deny?"
"There shall be sent against you a flame of fire, and smoke; and you shall not be able to help yourselves."
"Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will you twain deny?"
"And when the heaven is rent asunder, and becomes red like red hide — "
"Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will you twain deny? — "
On that day neither man nor Jinn will be asked about his sin.
"Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will you twain deny?"
"The guilty will be known by their marks, and they will be seized by the forelocks and the feet."
"Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will you twain deny?"
"This is the Hell which the guilty deny,"
Between it and fierce boiling water will they go round.
"Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will you twain deny?"
But for him who fears to stand before his Lord there are two Gardens — 
"Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will you twain deny? — "
Having many varieties (of trees).
"Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will you twain deny?"
In both of them there are two fountains flowing (free).
"Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will you twain deny?"
Therein will be every (kind of) fruit in pairs.
"Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will you twain deny?"
" (They will) recline (on couches) above carpets, the linings of which will be of thick brocade. And the ripe fruit of the two Gardens will be within easy reach."
"Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will you twain deny?"
"Therein will (also) be (chaste maidens) of modest gaze, whom neither man nor Jinn will have touched before them — "
"Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will you twain deny? — "
As if they were rubies and small pearls.
"Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will you twain deny?"
The reward of goodness is nothing but goodness.
"Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will you twain deny?"
"And besides these two, there are two (other) Gardens — "
"Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will you twain deny? — "
Dark green with foliage.
"Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will you twain deny?"
Therein (also) will be two springs gushing forth with water.
"Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will you twain deny?"
"In both of them there will be (all kinds of) fruit, and dates and pomegranates."
"Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will you twain deny?"
"Therein will be (maidens), good (and) beautiful — "
"Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will you twain deny? — "
"Fair maidens with lovely black eyes, well-guarded in pavilions — "
"Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will you twain deny? — "
Whom neither man nor Jinn will have touched before them — 
"Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will you twain deny? — "
Reclining on green cushions and beautiful carpets.
"Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will you twain deny?"
"Blessed is the name of thy Lord, Master of Glory and Honour."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
When the Event comes to pass — 
None can say that its coming to pass is a lie — 
" (Some) it will bring low, (others) it will exalt."
"When the earth will be shaken (with) a (terrible) shaking,"
And the mountains will be shattered — a (complete) shattering.
"They shall (all) become like dust particles scattered about,"
And you shall be (divided into) three groups:
" (First), those on the right hand — how (lucky) are those on the right hand! — "
" (Second), those on the left hand —  how (unlucky) are those on the left hand! — "
" (Third), the foremost; they are the foremost;"
They will have achieved nearness (to God).
 (They will be) in the Gardens of Bliss — 
"A large party from among the early (Muslims),"
"And a few from the later ones,"
" (Seated) on couches inwrought (with gold and jewels),"
Reclining thereon facing each other.
"There will wait on them youths, who will not age,"
Carrying goblets and ewers and cups (filled) out of a flowing spring — 
"No headache will they get therefrom, nor will they be intoxicated — "
"And (carrying) such fruits as they choose,"
And flesh of birds as they may desire.
"And (there will be) fair maidens with wide, lovely eyes,"
"Like pearls, well preserved,"
As a reward for what they did.
"They will not hear therein any vain or sinful talk,"
"Except (only) the word (of salutation), ‘Peace, peace.’"
And (as for) those on the right hand — how (lucky) are those on the right hand! — 
" (They) will be amidst thornless lote-trees,"
"And clustered bananas,"
"And extended shade,"
"And flowing water,"
"And abundant fruit,"
"Neither failing, nor forbidden,"
And (they will have) noble spouses — 
"Verily, We have created them a (good) creation,"
"And made them virgins,"
"Loving, of equal age"
With those on the right hand:
"A large party from among the early (Muslims),"
And a large party from the later ones.
But (as for) those on the left hand — how (unlucky) are those on the left hand! — 
" (They will be) in the midst of scorching winds and scalding water,"
"And under the shadow of black smoke,"
Neither cool nor of any good.
Before this they lived a life of ease and plenty
And used to persist in extreme sinfulness.
"And they were wont to say, ‘What! when we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we indeed be raised again,"
‘And our fathers of yore too?’
"Say, ‘(Yes), the earlier ones and the later ones"
‘Will (all) be gathered together unto the fixed time of an appointed day.
"‘Then, O ye that have gone astray and have rejected (the truth),"
"‘You will surely eat of the tree of Zaqqum,"
"‘And will fill (your) bellies therewith,"
"‘And will drink thereon of boiling water,"
‘Drinking like the drinking of the camels that suffer from an insatiable thirst.’
This will be their entertainment on the Day of Judgment.
"We have created you. Why, then, do you not accept (the truth)?"
What think ye (of the sperm-drop) that you emit?
Is it you who have created it or are We the Creator?
We have ordained death for (all of) you; and We cannot be prevented
"From bringing in your place others like you, and (from) developing you into a form which (at present) you know not."
"And you have certainly known the first creation. Why, then, do you not reflect?"
Do you see what you sow?
Is it you who grow it or are We the Grower?
"If We (so) pleased, We could reduce it all to broken pieces, then you would keep lamenting:"
‘We are ruined!
"‘Nay, we are deprived (of everything).’"
Do you see the water which you drink?
"Is it you who send it down from the clouds, or are We the Sender?"
"If We (so) pleased, We could make it bitter. Why, then, are you not grateful?"
Do you see the fire which you kindle?
"Is it you who produce the tree for it, or are We the Producer?"
We have made it a reminder and a benefit for the wayfarers.
"So glorify the name of thy Lord, the Great."
"Nay, I swear by the shooting of the stars — "
"And, indeed, that is a grand oath, if you only knew — "
"That this is indeed a noble Qur’an,"
"In a well-preserved Book,"
Which none shall touch except those who are purified.
 (It is) a revelation from the Lord of the worlds.
Is it this (Divine) discourse that you would reject?
And do you make the denial thereof your (means of) livelihood?
"Why, then, when (the soul of the dying man) reaches the throat,"
And you are at that moment looking on — 
"And We are nearer to him than you, but you see not — "
"Why, then, if you are not to be called to account,"
"You cannot bring it back, if you are truthful?"
"Now if he be of those who have attained nearness (to God),"
Then (for him) is comfort and fragrance (of happiness) and a Garden of Bliss;
"And if he be of those who are on the right hand,"
"Then ‘Peace be on thee, (who is) from those on the right hand.’"
"But if he be of those who reject (the truth) and are in error,"
"Then (for him will be) an entertainment of boiling water,"
And burning in Hell.
"Verily, this is the certain truth."
"So glorify the name of thy Lord, the Great."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"Whatever is in the heavens and the earth glorifies Allah; and He is the Mighty, the Wise."
His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; He gives life and He causes death; and He has power over all things.
"He is the First and the Last, and the Manifest and the Hidden, and He knows all things full well."
"He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six periods, then He settled Himself on the Throne. He knows what enters the earth and what comes out of it, and what comes down from heaven and what goes up into it. And He is with you wheresoever you may be. And Allah sees all that you do."
His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; and to Allah are all affairs referred.
He causes the night to pass into the day and causes the day to pass into the night; and He knows full well all that is in the breasts.
"Believe in Allah and His Messenger, and spend (in the way of Allah) out of that to which He has made you heirs. And those of you who believe and spend will have a great reward."
"Why is it that you believe not in Allah, while the Messenger calls you to believe in your Lord, and He has already taken a covenant from you, if indeed you are believers?"
"He it is Who sends down clear Signs to His servant, that He may bring you out of every (kind of) darkness into the light. And verily, Allah is Compassionate (and) Merciful to you."
"And why is it that you spend not in the way of Allah, while to Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth? Those of you who spent and fought before the Victory are not equal (to those who did so later). They are greater in rank than those who spent and fought afterwards. And to all has Allah promised good. And Allah is Well-Aware of what you do."
"Who is he that will lend to Allah a goodly loan? So He will increase it manifold for him, and he will have a generous reward."
"And (think of) the day when thou wilt see the believing men and the believing women, their light running before them and on their right hands, (and it will be said to them), ‘Glad tidings for you this day! Gardens through which streams flow, wherein you will abide. That is the supreme triumph.’"
" (On) the day when the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women will say to those who believe, ‘Wait (a while) for us that we may take light from your light,’ it will be said (to them), ‘Go ye back (if you can), and seek for light.’ Then there will be set up between them a wall with a door in it. The inside of it will be (all) mercy and in front, outside it, will be torment."
"They will call out to them, (saying), ‘Were we not with you?’ They will answer, ‘Yea, but you led yourselves into temptation and you  hesitated and doubted and your vain desires deceived you till the decree of Allah came to pass. And the Deceiver deceived you in respect of Allah."
"‘So this day no ransom shall be accepted from you, nor from those who disbelieved. Your final abode is the Fire; that is your friend; and a very evil destination it is.’"
"Has not the time arrived for those who believe that their hearts should feel humbled at the remembrance of Allah and at the truth which has come down (to them), and that they should not become like those who were given the Book before them and the term was prolonged for them, but their hearts were hardened, and many of them are wicked?"
"Know that Allah is (now) quickening the earth after its death. We have made the Signs manifest to you, that you may understand."
" (As to) the men that give alms, and the women that give alms, and those who lend to Allah a goodly loan — it will be increased manifold for them, and theirs will (also) be an honourable reward — "
"And those who believe in Allah and His Messengers (and) they are the Truthful and the Witnesses in the sight of their Lord, they will have their reward and their light. But (as for) those who disbelieve and reject Our Signs, these are the inmates of Hell."
"Know that the life of this world is only a sport and a pastime, and an adornment, and (a source of) boasting among yourselves, and (of) rivalry in  multiplying riches and children. (This life is) like the rain the vegetation produced whereby rejoices the tillers. Then it dries up and thou seest it turn yellow; then it becomes broken pieces (of straw). And in the Hereafter there is severe punishment, and (also) forgiveness from Allah, and (His) pleasure. And the life of this world is nothing but (temporary) enjoyment of deceitful things."
"Vie with one another in seeking forgiveness from your Lord and for a Garden the value whereof is equal to the value of the heaven and the earth; it has been prepared for those who believe in Allah and His Messenger. That is Allah’s grace; He bestows it upon whomsoever He pleases, and Allah is the Lord of immense grace."
"There befalls not any calamity either in the earth or in your (own) persons, but it is (recorded) in a Book before We bring it into being —  surely, that is easy for Allah — "
"That you may not grieve over what is lost to you nor exult because of that which He has given to you. And Allah loves not any selfconceited boaster,"
"Such as are niggardly and (also) enjoin upon men to be niggardly. And whoso turns his back, then surely Allah is Self-Sufficient, Worthy of all praise."
"Verily, We sent Our Messengers with manifest Signs and sent down with them the Book and the Balance that people may act with justice; and We sent down iron, wherein is (material for) violent warfare and  (many) benefits for mankind, and that Allah may distinguish those who help Him and His Messengers without having seen (Him). Surely, Allah is Powerful, Mighty."
"And We did send Noah and Abraham, and We placed among their seed prophethood and the Book. So some of them followed the guidance, but many of them were rebellious."
"Then We caused Our Messengers to follow in their footsteps; and We caused Jesus, son of Mary, to follow (them), and We gave him the Gospel. And We placed in the hearts of those who accepted him compassion and mercy. But monasticism which they invented for themselves —  We did not prescribe it for them — for the seeking of Allah’s pleasure; but they did not observe it with due observance. Yet We gave those of them who believed their (due) reward, but many of them are rebellious."
"O ye who believe! fear Allah and believe in His Messenger; He will give you a double share of His mercy, and will provide for you a light wherein you will walk, and will grant you forgiveness — and verily Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful — "
That the People of the Book may not think that they (the Muslims) have no power to attain aught of the grace of Allah; whereas grace is (entirely) in the hands of Allah. He gives it to whomsoever He pleases. And Allah is the Master of immense grace.
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"Allah has indeed heard the speech of her who pleads with thee concerning her husband, and complains unto Allah. And Allah has heard your dialogue. Verily, Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing."
"Those among you who put away their wives by calling them mothers —  they do not become their mothers; their mothers are only those who gave them birth; and they certainly utter words that are manifestly evil and untrue; but surely Allah is the Effacer of sins, Most Forgiving."
" (As to) those who call their wives mothers, and then would go back on what they have said, (the penalty for it) is the freeing of a slave before they touch each other. This is what you are admonished with. And Allah is Well-Aware of what you do."
"But whoso does not find (one), he must fast for two successive months, before they touch each other. And whoso is not able to do so, should feed sixty poor people. This (is so), that you may (truly) believe in Allah and His Messenger. And these are the limits (prescribed) by Allah; and for the disbelievers is a painful punishment."
Those who oppose Allah and His Messenger will surely be abased even as those before them were abased; and We have already sent down clear Signs. And the disbelievers will have an humiliating punishment.
" (On) the day when Allah will raise them all together, He will inform them of what they did. Allah has kept account of it, while they forgot it. And Allah is Witness over all things."
"Dost thou not see that Allah knows all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth? There is no secret counsel of three, but He is their fourth, nor of five, but He is their sixth, nor of less than that, nor of more, but He is with them wheresoever they may be. Then on the Day of Resurrection He will inform them of what they did. Surely, Allah knows all things full well."
"Hast thou not seen those who were forbidden (to hold) secret counsels and again return to what they were forbidden, and confer secretly for sin and transgression and disobedience to the Messenger? And when they come to thee, they greet thee with (a greeting with) which Allah has not greeted thee; but among themselves they say, ‘Why does not Allah punish us for what we say?’ Sufficient for them is Hell, wherein they will burn; and a most evil destination it is!"
"O ye who believe! when you confer together in secret, confer not for (the commission of) sin and transgression and disobedience to the Messenger, but confer for (the attainment of) virtue and righteousness, and fear Allah unto Whom you shall (all) be gathered."
" (Holding of) secret counsels (for evil purposes) is only of Satan, that he may cause grief to those who believe; but it cannot harm them in the least, except by Allah’s leave. And in Allah should the believers put their trust."
"O ye who believe! when it is said to you, ‘Make room!’ in (your) assemblies, then do make room; Allah will make ample room for you. And when it is said, ‘Rise up!’ then rise up; Allah will raise those who believe from among you, and those to whom knowledge is given, to degrees (of rank). And Allah is Well-Aware of what you do."
"O ye who believe! when you consult the Messenger in private, give alms before your consultation. That is better for you and purer. But if you find not (anything to give), then Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"Are you afraid of giving alms before your consultation? So, when you do not do so and Allah has been merciful to you, then observe Prayer and pay the Zakat and obey Allah and His Messenger. And Allah is Well-Aware of what you do."
"Hast thou not seen those who make friends with a people with whom Allah is wroth? They are neither of you nor of them, and they swear to falsehood knowingly."
Allah has prepared for them a severe punishment. Evil indeed is that which they used to do.
"They have made their oaths a screen (for their misdeeds), and they turn (men) away from the path of Allah; for them, therefore, will be an humiliating punishment."
Neither their riches nor their children will avail them aught against Allah. They are the inmates  of the Fire wherein they will abide.
" (On) the day when Allah will raise them all together, they will swear to Him even as they swear to you, and they will think that they have something (to stand upon). Now surely it is they who are the liars."
"Satan has gained mastery over them, and has made them forget the remembrance of Allah. They are Satan’s party. Now surely it is Satan’s party that are the losers."
Certainly those who oppose Allah and His Messenger will be among the lowest.
"Allah has decreed: ‘Most surely I will prevail, I and My Messengers.’ Verily, Allah is Powerful, Mighty."
"Thou wilt not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day loving those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, even though they be their fathers, or their sons or their brethren, or their kindred. These are they in whose hearts Allah has inscribed (true) faith and whom He has strengthened with inspiration from Himself. And He will make them enter Gardens through which streams flow. Therein will they abide. Allah is well pleased with them, and they are well pleased with Him. They are Allah’s party. Hearken ye (O people)! it is Allah’s party who will be successful."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth glorifies Allah; and He is the Mighty, the Wise."
"He it is Who turned out the disbelievers among the People of the Book from their homes at (the time of) the first banishment. You did not think that they would go forth, and they thought that their fortresses would defend them against Allah. But Allah came upon them whence they did not expect, and cast terror into their hearts, so that they destroyed their houses with their own hands and the hands of the believers. So take a lesson, O ye who have eyes!"
"And had it not been that Allah had decreed exile for them, He would have surely punished them (otherwise) in this world. And in the Hereafter they will certainly have the punishment of the Fire."
That is because they opposed Allah and His Messenger; and whoso opposes Allah — then surely Allah is Severe in retribution.
"Whatever palm-trees you cut down or left standing on their roots, it was by Allah’s leave, and that He might disgrace the transgressors."
"And whatever Allah has given to His Messenger as spoils from them, you urged neither horse nor camel for that; but Allah grants power to  His Messenger over whomsoever He pleases; and Allah has power over all things."
"Whatever Allah has given to His Messenger as spoils from the people of the towns is for Allah and for the Messenger and for the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer, that it may not circulate (only) among those of you who are rich. And whatsoever the Messenger gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain from (that). And fear Allah; surely, Allah is Severe in retribution."
" (These spoils are) for the poor Refugees who have been driven out from their homes and their possessions while seeking grace from Allah and (His) pleasure, and helping Allah and His Messenger. These it is who are true (in their faith)."
"And those who had established (their) home (in this city) before them and (had accepted) faith, love those who came to them for refuge, and find not in their breasts any desire for that which is given them (Refugees), but prefer (the Refugees) to themselves, even though poverty be their (own lot). And whoso is rid of the covetousness of his own soul — it is these who will be successful."
"And (the spoils are also for) those who came after them. They say, ‘Our Lord, forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in the faith, and leave not in our hearts any rancour against those who believe. Our Lord! Thou art indeed Compassionate, Merciful.’"
"Hast thou not seen those who are hypocrites? They say to their brethren who disbelieve among the People of the Book, ‘If you are turned out, we will surely go out with you, and we will never obey anyone against you: and if you are fought against, we will certainly help you.’ But Allah bears witness that surely they are liars."
"If they are turned out, they will never go out with them; and if they are fought against they will never help them. And even if they help them, they will assuredly turn (their) backs; and then they shall not be helped."
"Of a truth, they have greater fear of you in their hearts than of Allah. That is because they are a people who are devoid of (all) reason."
"They will not fight you in a body except in fortified towns or from behind walls. Their fighting among themselves is severe. Thou thinkest them to be united, but their hearts are divided. That is because they are a people who have no sense."
" (Their case is) like (the case of) those who have, a short time before them, tasted the evil consequences of their doings. And for them is a painful punishment."
" (It is) like (that of) Satan, when he says to man, ‘Disbelieve;’ but when he disbelieves, he says, ‘I have nothing to do with thee; I fear Allah, the Lord of the worlds.’"
"And the end of both will be that they will both be in the Fire, abiding therein. Such is the reward of the wrongdoers."
O ye who believe! fear Allah; and let (every) soul look to what it sends forth for the morrow. And fear Allah; verily Allah is Well-Aware of what you do.
"And be not like those who forgot Allah, and whom He has (consequently) caused to forget their own souls. It is they that are the rebellious."
The inmates of the Fire and the inmates of the Garden are not equal. It is the inmates of the Garden that will triumph.
"If We had sent down this Qur’an on a mountain, thou wouldst certainly have seen it humbled and rent asunder for fear of Allah. And these are similitudes that We set forth for mankind that they may reflect."
"He is Allah, and there is no God beside Him, the Knower of the unseen and the seen. He is the Gracious, the Merciful."
"He is Allah, and there is no God beside Him, the Sovereign, the Holy One, the Source of Peace, the Bestower of Security, the Protector, the Mighty, the Subduer, the Exalted. Holy is Allah (far) above that which they associate (with Him)."
"He is Allah, the Creator, the Maker, the Fashioner. His are the most beautiful names. All that is in the heavens and the earth glorifies Him, and He is the Mighty, the Wise."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"O ye who believe! take not My enemy and your enemy for friends, offering them love, while they disbelieve in the truth which has come to you (and) drive out the Messenger and yourselves (from your homes merely) because you believe in Allah, your Lord. If you go forth, to strive in My cause and seek My pleasure, (take them not for friends), sending them (messages of) love in secret, while I know best what you conceal and what you reveal. And whoever of you does so, has, surely, lost the right path."
"If they get the upper hand of you, they show themselves to be your (active) enemies, and will stretch forth their hands and their tongues towards you with evil (intent); and they ardently desire that you should become disbelievers."
Neither your ties of kindred nor your children will avail you aught on the Day of Resurrection. He will decide between you. And Allah sees all that you do.
"There is a good model for you in Abraham and those with him, when they said to their people, ‘We have nothing to do with you and with that which you worship beside Allah. We disbelieve all that you (believe). There has arisen enmity and hatred between us and you for ever, until you believe in Allah alone’ — with the exception of (this) saying of  Abraham to his father, ‘I will surely ask forgiveness for thee, though I have no power (to prevail) upon Allah in favour of thee.’ (They prayed to God saying), ‘Our Lord, in Thee do we put our trust and to Thee do we turn (repentant), and towards Thee is the (final) return."
"‘Our Lord, make us not a trial for those who disbelieve, and forgive us, our Lord; for Thou alone art the Mighty, the Wise.’"
"Surely, there is a good example in them for you — for (all) who have hope in Allah and the Last Day. And whosoever turns away — truly, Allah is Self-Sufficient, Worthy of all praise."
"It may be that Allah will bring about love between you and those of them with whom you are (now) at enmity; and Allah is All-Powerful; and Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"Allah forbids you not, respecting those who have not fought against you on account of (your) religion, and who have not driven you forth from your homes, that you be kind to them and act equitably towards them; surely Allah loves those who are equitable."
"Allah only forbids you, respecting those who have fought against you on account of (your) religion, and have driven you out of your homes, and have helped (others) in driving you out, that you make friends of them, and whosoever makes friends of them — it is these that are the transgressors."
"O ye who believe! when believing women come to you as Refugees, examine them. Allah  knows best their faith. Then, if you find them (true) believers, send them not back to the disbelievers. These (women) are not lawful for them, nor are they lawful for these (women). But give (their disbelieving husbands) what they have spent (on them). And it is no sin for you to marry them, when you have given them their dowries. And hold not to (your) matrimonial ties with the disbelieving women; but demand (the return of) that which you have spent; and let (the disbelievers) demand that which they have spent. That is the judgment of Allah. He judges between you. And Allah is All-Knowing, Wise."
"And if any of your wives goes away from you to the disbelievers, then when you retaliate (and get some spoils from the disbelievers), give to those believers whose wives have gone away the like of that which they had spent (on their wives). And fear Allah in Whom you believe."
"O Prophet! when believing women come to thee, taking the oath of allegiance (at thy hands) that they will not associate anything with Allah, and that they will not steal, and will not commit adultery, nor kill their children, nor bring forth a scandalous charge which they themselves have deliberately forged, nor disobey thee in what is right, then accept their allegiance and ask Allah to forgive them. Verily, Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
O ye who believe! make not friends of a people with whom Allah is wroth; they have indeed despaired of the Hereafter just as have the disbelievers despaired of those who are in the graves.
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth glorifies Allah; and He is the Mighty, the Wise."
O ye who believe! why do you say what you do not do?
Most hateful is it in the sight of Allah that you say what you do not do.
"Verily, Allah loves those who fight in His cause arrayed in (solid) ranks, as though they were a (strong) structure cemented with (molten) lead."
"And (remember) when Moses said to his people, ‘O my people, why do you vex and slander me and you know that I am Allah’s Messenger unto you?’ So when they deviated (from the right course), Allah caused their hearts to deviate, for Allah guides not the rebellious people."
"And (remember) when Jesus, son of Mary, said, ‘O children of Israel, surely I am Allah’s Messenger unto you, fulfilling that which is before me of the Torah, and giving glad tidings of a Messenger who will come after me. His name will be Ahmad.’ And when he came to them with clear proofs, they said, ‘This is clear enchantment.’"
But who could do greater wrong than one who forges the lie against Allah while he is called to Islam? Allah guides not the wrongdoing people.
"They desire to extinguish the light of Allah with (the breath of) their mouths, but Allah will perfect His light, even if the disbelievers hate (it)."
"He it is Who has sent His Messenger with the guidance and the Religion of truth, that He may cause it to prevail over all religions, even if those who associate partners (with God) hate (it)."
O ye who believe! shall I point out to you a bargain that will save you from a painful punishment?
"That you believe in Allah and His Messenger, and strive in the cause of Allah with your wealth and your persons. That is better for you, if you did but know."
"He will forgive you your sins, and make you enter the Gardens through which streams flow, and pure and pleasant dwellings in Gardens of Eternity. That is the supreme triumph."
And (He will bestow) another (favour) which you love: help from Allah and a near victory. So give glad tidings to the believers.
"O ye who believe! be helpers of Allah, as said Jesus, son of Mary, to (his) disciples, ‘Who are my helpers in (the cause of) Allah.’ The disciples said, ‘We are helpers of Allah.’ So a party of the children of Israel believed, while a party disbelieved. Then We gave power to those who believed against their enemy, and they became victorious."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth glorifies Allah, the Sovereign, the Holy, the Mighty, the Wise."
"He it is Who has raised among the Unlettered (people) a Messenger from among themselves who recites unto them His Signs, and purifies them, and teaches them the Book and wisdom, although they had been, before, in manifest misguidance;"
"And (among) others from among them who have not yet joined them. He is the Mighty, the Wise."
That is Allah’s grace; He bestows it on whom He pleases; and Allah is the Master of immense grace.
"The likeness of those who were made to bear the (law of) Torah, but would not bear it, is as the likeness of an ass carrying (a load of) books. Evil is the likeness of the people who reject the Signs of Allah. And Allah guides not the wrongdoing people."
"Say, ‘O ye who are Jews, if you think you are the friends of Allah to the exclusion of (all) other people, then wish for Death, if (indeed) you are truthful.’"
"But they will never wish for it, because of that which their hands have sent on (before them). And Allah knows full well those who do wrong."
"Say, ‘The Death from which you flee will surely meet you. Then will you be returned unto Him Who knows the unseen and the seen, and He will inform you of what you had been doing.’"
"O ye who believe! when the call is made for Prayer on Friday, hasten to the remembrance of Allah, and leave off (all) business. That is better for you, if you only knew."
"And when the Prayer is finished, then disperse in the land and seek of Allah’s grace, and remember Allah much, that you may prosper."
"But when they see some merchandise or some amusement, they break up for it, and leave thee standing. Say, ‘That which is with Allah is better than amusement and merchandise, and Allah is the Best Provider.’"
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"When the hypocrites come to thee, they say, ‘We bear witness that thou art indeed the Messenger of Allah.’ And Allah knows that thou art indeed His Messenger, but Allah bears witness that the hypocrites are surely liars."
They have made their oaths a shield; thus they turn (men) away from the way of Allah. Evil surely is that which they have been doing.
"That is because they (first) believed, then disbelieved. So a seal was set upon their hearts and (consequently) they understand not."
"And when thou seest them, their figures please thee; and if they speak, thou listenest to their speech. (They are) as though they were (blocks of) wood propped up. They think that every cry is against them. They are the enemy, so beware of them. Allah’s curse be upon them! How are they being turned away!"
"And when it is said to them, ‘Come, that the Messenger of Allah may ask forgiveness for you,’ they turn their heads aside, and thou seest them keeping back while they are full of pride."
"It is equal to them whether thou ask forgiveness for them or ask not forgiveness for them, Allah will never forgive them. Surely Allah guides not the rebellious people."
"They it is who say, ‘Spend not on those who are with the Messenger of Allah that they may disperse (and leave him);’ while to Allah belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth; but the hypocrites understand not."
"They say, ‘If we return to Medina, the one most honourable will surely drive out therefrom the one most mean;’ while (true) honour belongs to Allah and to His Messenger and the believers; but the hypocrites know not."
O ye who believe! let not your wealth and your children divert you from the remembrance of Allah. And whoever does so — it is they who are the losers.
"And spend out of that with which We have provided you before death comes upon one of you and he says, ‘My Lord! if only Thou wouldst grant me respite for a little while, then I would give alms and be among the righteous.’"
And Allah will not grant respite to a soul when its appointed time has come; and Allah is Well-Aware of what you do.
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth glorifies Allah; His is the kingdom and His the praise, and He has power over all things."
"It is He Who has created you, but (some) of you are disbelievers and (some) of you are believers; and Allah sees what you do."
"He created the heavens and the earth with truth, and He shaped you and made your shapes beautiful, and to Him is the (ultimate) return."
"He knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth, and He knows what you conceal and what you disclose; and Allah knows full well (all) that is in the breasts."
"Has not the news reached you of those who disbelieved before? So they tasted the evil consequences of their conduct, and they had a painful punishment."
"That was because their Messengers came to them with manifest Signs, but they said, ‘Shall mortals guide us?’ So they disbelieved and turned away, but Allah had never any need (of them); and Allah is Self- Sufficient, Worthy of all praise."
"Those who disbelieve assert that they will not be raised up. Say, ‘Yea, by my Lord, you shall surely be  raised up; then shall you surely be informed of what you did. And that is easy for Allah.’"
"Believe, therefore, in Allah and His Messenger, and in the Light which We have sent down. And Allah is Well-Aware of all that you do."
"The day when He shall gather you, on the Day of Gathering, that will be the day of mutual loss (and gain). And whoso believes in Allah and does good deeds — He will remove from them the evil (consequences) of their deeds and He will make them enter Gardens through which streams flow, to abide therein for ever. That is the supreme triumph."
"But (as to) those who disbelieve and reject Our Signs, these shall be the inmates of the Fire, wherein they shall abide; and an evil destination it is!"
There befalls not any affliction but by the leave of Allah. And whosoever believes in Allah — He guides his heart (aright). And Allah knows all things full well.
"And obey Allah and obey the Messenger. But if you turn away, then Our Messenger is responsible only for the clear conveying (of the Message)."
Allah! there is no God but He; so in Allah let the believers put their trust.
"O ye who believe! surely among your wives and your children are (some that are really) your enemies, so beware of them. And if you overlook and forgive and pardon, then surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"Verily, your wealth and your children are a trial; but with Allah is an immense reward."
"So fear Allah as best you can, and listen, and obey, and spend (in His cause); it will be good for yourselves. And whoso is rid of the covetousness of his own soul — it is such who shall be successful."
"If you lend to Allah a good loan, He will multiply it for you, and will forgive you; and Allah is Most Appreciating, Forbearing,"
"The Knower of the unseen and the seen, the Mighty, the Wise."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"O Prophet! when you divorce women, divorce them for the (prescribed) period, and reckon the period; and fear Allah. Turn them not out of their houses, nor should they (themselves) leave unless they commit an act which is manifestly foul. And these are the limits (set) by Allah; and whoso transgresses the limits of Allah, he indeed wrongs his own soul. Thou knowest not; it may be that thereafter Allah will bring something new to pass."
"Then, when they are about to reach their (prescribed) term, keep them with kindness, or put them away with kindness, and call to witness two just persons from among you; and bear (true) witness for Allah. This is by which is admonished he who believes in Allah and the Last Day. And he who fears Allah — He will make for him a way out,"
"And will provide for him from where he expects not. And he who puts his trust in Allah — He is sufficient for him. Verily, Allah will accomplish His purpose. For everything has Allah appointed a measure."
"And if you are in doubt (as to) such of your women as despair of monthly courses, then (know that) the prescribed period for them is three months, and (the same is for) such as have not had their monthly courses  (yet). And (as for those) who are with child, their period shall be until they are delivered of their burden. And whoso fears Allah, He will provide facilities for him in his affair."
That is the command of Allah which He has revealed to you. And whoso fears Allah — He will remove the evil (consequences) of his deeds and will enlarge his reward.
"Lodge them (during the prescribed period) in the houses wherein you dwell, according to (the best of) your means; and harass them not that you may create hardships for them. And if they be with child, spend on them until they are delivered of their burden. And if they give suck (to the child) for you, give them their recompense, and consult with one another in kindness; but if you meet with difficulty from each other, then another (woman shall) suckle (the child) for him (the father)."
Let him who has abundance of means spend out of his abundance. And let him whose means of subsistence are straitened spend out of what Allah has given him. Allah burdens not any soul beyond that which He has given it. Allah will soon bring about ease after hardship.
"How many a city rebelled against the command of its Lord and His Messengers, and We called it to severe account, and punished it with dire punishment!"
"So it tasted the evil consequences of its conduct, and the end of its affair was ruin."
"Allah has prepared for them a severe punishment; so fear Allah, O ye men of understanding, who have believed. Allah has indeed sent down to you a Reminder — "
"A Messenger, who recites unto you the clear Signs of Allah, that he may bring those who believe and do good deeds out of every (kind of) darkness into light. And whoso believes in Allah and does good deeds — He will make him enter Gardens, through which rivers flow, to abide therein for ever. Allah has indeed made excellent provision for him."
"Allah is He Who created seven heavens, and of the earth the like thereof. The (divine) command comes down in their midst, that you may know that Allah has power over all things, and that Allah encompasses all things in (His) knowledge."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"O Prophet! why dost thou forbid (thyself) that which Allah has made lawful to thee, seeking the pleasure of thy wives? And Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful."
"Allah has indeed allowed to you the dissolution of your oaths, and Allah is your Friend; and He is All-Knowing, Wise."
"And when the Prophet confided a matter unto one of his wives and she then divulged it, and Allah informed him of it, he made known (to her) part thereof, and avoided (mentioning) part (of it). And when he informed her of it, she said, ‘Who has informed thee of it?’ He said, ‘The All-Knowing, the All-Aware (God) has informed me.’"
" (Now) if you two turn unto Allah repentant, (it will be better for you), and your hearts are (already so) inclined. But if you back up each other against him, surely Allah is his Helper and Gabriel and the righteous among the believers; and furthermore, (all other) angels (too) are (his) helpers."
"It may be that, if he divorce you, his Lord will give him instead wives better than you — resigned, believing, obedient, always turning to God, devout in worship, given to fasting, (both) widows and virgins."
"O ye who believe! save yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is men and stones, over  which are appointed angels, stern (and) severe, who disobey not Allah in what He commands them and do as they are commanded."
O ye who disbelieve! make no excuses this day. You are requited for what you did.
"O ye who believe! turn to Allah in sincere repentance. It may be that your Lord will remove the evil (consequences) of your deeds and make you enter Gardens through which rivers flow, on the day when Allah will not abase the Prophet nor those who have believed with him. Their light will run before them and on their right hands. They will say, ‘Our Lord, perfect our light for us and forgive us; surely Thou hast power over all things.’"
"O Prophet! strive hard against the disbelievers and the hypocrites; and be strict against them. Their home is Hell, and an evil destination it is!"
"Allah sets forth for those who disbelieve the example of the wife of Noah and the wife of Lot. They were under two righteous servants of Ours, but they acted unfaithfully towards them. So they availed them naught against Allah, and it was said (to them), ‘Enter the Fire, ye twain, along with those who enter.’"
"And Allah sets forth for those who believe the example of the wife of Pharaoh when she said, ‘My Lord! build for me a house with Thee in the Garden; and deliver me from Pharaoh and his work, and deliver me from the wrongdoing people;’"
"And (the example of) Mary, the daughter of ‘Imran, who guarded her private parts — so We breathed into him of Our Spirit — and she fulfilled (in her person) the words of her Lord and His Books and was one of the obedient."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"Blessed is He in Whose hand is the kingdom, and He has power over all things;"
"Who has created death and life that He might try you — which of you is best in deeds; and He is the Mighty, the Most Forgiving."
Who has created seven heavens in harmony. No incongruity canst thou see in the creation of the Gracious (God). Then look again: Seest thou any flaw?
"Aye, look again, and yet again, thy sight will (only) return unto thee confused and fatigued."
"And verily, We have adorned the lowest heaven with lamps, and We have made them for driving away satans, and We have prepared for them the punishment of the blazing Fire."
"And for those who disbelieve in their Lord there is the punishment of Hell, and an evil resort it is!"
"When they are cast therein, they will hear it roaring as it boils up."
"It would almost burst with fury. Whenever a host (of disbelievers) is cast into it the wardens thereof will ask them, ‘Did no Warner come to you?’"
"They will say, “Yea, verily, a Warner did come to us, but we treated (him) as a liar, and we said:  ‘Allah has not revealed anything; you are but in great error.’ ”"
"And they will say, ‘If we had but listened or possessed sense, we should not have been among the inmates of the blazing Fire.’"
Then will they confess their sins; but far away are the inmates of the blazing Fire (from God)’(s mercy).
"Verily, those who fear their Lord in secret — for them is forgiveness and a great reward."
"And whether you conceal what you say or make it public, He knows full well what is in (your) breasts."
"Does He Who has created (you) not know (it)? He is the Knower of all subtleties, the All-Aware."
"He it is Who has made the earth even and smooth for you; so traverse through its sides, and eat of His provision. And unto Him will be the resurrection."
Do you feel secure from Him Who is in the heaven that He will not cause the earth to sink with you when lo! it begins to shake?
Do you feel secure from Him Who is in the heaven that He will not send against you a sandstorm? Then will you know how (terrible) was My warning.
And indeed those before them also treated (My Messengers) as liars; then how (grievous) was My punishment!
"Have they not seen the birds above them, spreading out their wings without moving (them) and then drawing (them) in (to swoop down upon the prey)? None withholds  them but the Gracious (God). Verily He sees all things."
Or who is he that can be an army for you to help you against the Gracious (God)? The disbelievers are only in deception.
"Or who is he that will provide for you, if He should withhold His provision? Nay, but they obstinately persist in rebellion and aversion."
What! is he who walks grovelling upon his face better guided or he who walks upright on the straight path?
"Say, ‘He it is Who brought you into being, and made for you ears and eyes and hearts; (but) little thanks do you give.’"
"Say, ‘He it is Who multiplied you in the earth, and unto Him will you be gathered.’"
"And they say, ‘When will this promise (come to pass), if (indeed) you are truthful?’"
"Say, ‘The knowledge (of it) is with Allah, and I am only a plain Warner.’"
"But when they see it near, the faces of those who disbelieve will become grief-stricken, and it will be said, ‘This is what you used to ask for.’"
"Say, ‘Tell me, if Allah should destroy me and those who are with me, or have mercy on us, who will protect the disbelievers from a painful punishment?’"
"Say, ‘He is the Gracious (God); in Him have we believed and in Him have we put our trust. And you will soon know who is in manifest error.’"
"Say, ‘Tell me, if (all) your water were to disappear (in the earth), who then will bring you (clear) flowing water?’"
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"By the inkstand and (by) the pen and (by) that which they write,"
"Thou art not, by the grace of thy Lord, a madman."
"And for thee, most surely, there is an unending reward."
And thou dost surely possess high moral excellences.
And thou wilt soon see and they (too) will see
Which of you is afflicted (with madness).
"Surely, thy Lord knows best those who go astray from His way, and He knows best those who follow guidance."
So comply not with the wishes of those who reject (the truth).
They wish that thou shouldst be pliant so that they may (also) be pliant.
"And yield not to any mean swearer,"
"Backbiter, one who goes about slandering,"
"Forbidder of good, transgressor, sinful,"
"Ill-mannered and, in addition to that, of doubtful birth."
This is because he possesses riches and children.
"When Our Signs are recited unto him, he says, ‘Stories of the ancients!’"
We will brand him on the snout.
"We will surely try them as We tried the owners of the garden when they vowed that they would certainly pluck (all) its (fruit) in the morning,"
"And they made no exception (and did not say), ‘(If God please).’"
Then a visitation from thy Lord visited it while they were asleep;
And the morning found it like (a garden) cut down (overnight).
"So they called to one another at (the break of) dawn,"
"Saying, ‘Go forth early in the morning to your field, if you would gather the fruit.’"
"And they set out, talking to one another in low tones,"
"Saying, ‘Let no poor man today enter it against you.’"
"And they went forth early in the morning, determined to (achieve their) purpose."
"But when they saw it, they said, ‘Surely, we have lost (our way)!"
"‘Nay, we have been deprived of everything.’"
"The best among them said, “Did I not say to you, ‘Why do you not glorify (God)?’ ”"
" (Now) they said, ‘Glory be to our Lord. Surely, we have been wrongdoers.’"
"Then some of them turned to the others, reproaching one another."
"They said, ‘Woe to us! We were indeed rebellious (against God)."
‘Maybe our Lord will give us instead (a) better (garden) than this; we do humbly entreat our Lord.’
Such is the punishment (of this world). And surely the punishment of the Hereafter is greater. Did they but know!
"For the righteous, indeed, there are Gardens of Bliss with their Lord."
Shall We then treat those who submit (to Us) as (We treat) the guilty?
What is the matter with you? How judge ye!
"Have you a Book wherein you read,"
That you shall surely have in it whatever you choose?
Or have you any covenant binding on Us till the Day of Resurrection that you shall surely have all that you order?
Ask them which of them will vouch for that.
"Or have they any ‘partners’ (of God)? Let them, then, produce (those) ‘partners’ of theirs, if they speak the truth."
"On the day when the truth shall be laid bare and they will be called upon to prostrate themselves, they will not be able (to do so);"
"Their eyes will be cast down, (and) humiliation will cover them; and they were indeed called upon to prostrate themselves when they were safe and sound, (but they obeyed not)."
So leave Me (alone) with those who reject this word (of Ours). We shall draw them (near to destruction) step by step from whence they know not.
And I give them respite; for My plan is strong.
Dost thou ask a reward of them that they are (as if) being weighed down with a (heavy) tax?
Is the unseen with them so that they write (it) down?
"So be thou steadfast in (carrying out) the command of thy Lord, and be not like the Man of the Fish when he called (to his Lord) and he was full of grief."
"Had not a favour from his Lord reached him, he would have surely been cast upon a bare tract of land, while he would have been blamed (by his people)."
But his Lord chose him and made him (one) of the righteous.
"And those who disbelieve would fain dislodge thee (from thy Godgiven station) with their (angry) looks when they hear the Reminder; and they say, ‘He is certainly mad.’"
"Nay, it is naught but (a source of) honour for all the worlds."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
The Inevitable!
What is the Inevitable?
And what should make thee know what the Inevitable is?
 (The tribe of) Thamud and (the tribe of) ‘Ad treated as a lie the (sudden) calamity.
"Then, as for Thamud, they were destroyed with a violent blast."
"And as for ‘Ad, they were destroyed by a fierce roaring wind,"
"Which He caused to blow against them for seven nights and eight days consecutively, so that thou mightest have seen the people therein lying prostrate, as though they were trunks of palm-trees fallen down."
Dost thou see any remnant of them?
"And Pharaoh, and those who were before him, and the overthrown cities (persistently) committed sins."
"And they disobeyed the Messenger of their Lord, therefore He seized them — a severe seizing."
"Verily, when the waters rose high, We bore you in the boat,"
"That We might make it a reminder for you, and that retaining ears might retain it."
"And when a single blast is sounded on the trumpet,"
"And the earth and the mountains are heaved up and then crushed in a single crash,"
On that day will the (great) Event come to pass.
"And the heaven will cleave asunder, and it will become frail that day."
"And the angels will be (standing) on the sides thereof, and above them on that day eight (angels) will bear the throne of thy Lord."
On that day you will be presented (before God); (and) none of your secrets will remain hidden.
"Then, as for him who is given his record in his right hand, he will say, ‘Come, read my record."
"‘Surely, I knew that I would meet my reckoning.’"
"So he will have a delightful life,"
"In a lofty Garden,"
Whereof clusters of fruit will be within easy reach.
‘Eat and drink joyfully because of the (good) deeds you did in days gone by.’
"But as for him who is given his record in his left hand, he will say, ‘O would that I had not been given my record!"
‘Nor known what my reckoning was!
‘O would that (death) had made an end (of me)!
‘My wealth has been of no avail to me.
‘My power has perished from me.’
"‘Seize him and fetter him,"
‘Then cast him into Hell.
‘Then put him into a chain the length of which is seventy cubits;
"‘Verily, he did not believe in Allah, the Great,"
‘And he did not urge the feeding of the poor.
"‘No friend, therefore, has he here this day;"
"‘Nor any food save blood mixed with water,"
‘Which none but the sinners eat.’
"But nay, I swear by all that you see,"
"And by all that you see not,"
That it is surely the word (brought) by a noble Messenger;
And it is not the word of a poet; little is it that you believe!
Nor is it the word of a soothsayer; little is it that you heed!
 (It is) a revelation from the Lord of the worlds.
"And if he had forged (and attributed) any sayings to Us,"
"We would surely have seized him by the right hand,"
"And then surely We would have severed his life-artery,"
And not one of you could have held (Us) off from him.
And verily it is a reminder for the righteous.
"And, surely, We know that there are some among you who reject (Our Signs)."
"And, verily, it will be a (source of) regret for the disbelievers."
"And surely, it is the true certainty."
"So glorify the name of thy Lord, the Great."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
An inquirer inquires concerning the punishment about to fall
"Upon the disbelievers, which none can repel."
" (It is) from Allah, Lord of (great) ascents."
The angels and the Spirit ascend to Him in a day the measure of which is fifty thousand years.
So be patient with admirable patience.
"They see it to be far off,"
But We see it to be nigh.
"The day when the heaven will become like molten copper,"
"And the mountains will become like flakes of wool,"
And a friend will not inquire after a friend.
"They will be placed in sight of one another, and the guilty one would fain ransom himself from the punishment of that day by (offering) his children,"
"And his wife and his brother,"
"And his kinsfolk who sheltered him,"
"And (by offering all) those who are on the earth, if (only) thus he might save himself."
"But no! surely it is a flame of Fire,"
Stripping off the skin (even) to the extremities (of the body).
It will call him who turned his back and retreated
"And hoarded (wealth), and withheld (it)."
"Verily, man is born impatient and miserly."
"When evil touches him, he is full of lamentation,"
"But when good falls to his (lot), he is niggardly."
But not those who pray.
"Those who are constant in their Prayer,"
And those in whose wealth there is a recognized right
For one who asks (for help) and (for one) who does not.
"And those who believe the Day of Judgment to be a reality,"
And those who are fearful of the punishment of their Lord — 
Verily the punishment of their Lord is not (a thing) to feel secure from — 
And those who guard their private parts — 
Except from their wives and (from) those whom their right hands possess; such indeed are not to blame;
"But those who seek to go beyond that, it is these who are transgressors — "
"And those who are watchful of their trusts and their covenants,"
"And those who are upright in their testimonies,"
And those who are strict in the observance of their Prayer.
"These will be in the Gardens, duly honoured."
"But what is the matter with those who disbelieve, that they come hastening towards thee,"
"From the right hand and from the left, in different parties?"
Does every man among them hope to enter the Garden of Bliss?
Never! We have created them of that which they know.
"But nay! I swear by the Lord of the easts and of the wests, that We have the power"
"To bring in their place others better than they, and We cannot be frustrated (in Our plans)."
"So leave them alone to indulge in idle talk and play until they meet that day of theirs which they are promised,"
"The day when they will come forth from their graves hastening, as though they were racing to a target,"
 (With) their eyes cast down; and disgrace will cover them. Such is the day which they are promised.
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"We sent Noah to his people, (saying), ‘Warn thy people before there comes upon them a grievous punishment.’"
"He said, ‘O my people! surely I am a plain Warner unto you,"
‘That you serve Allah and fear Him and obey me.
"‘He will forgive you your sins and grant you respite till an appointed time. Verily the time appointed by Allah cannot be put back when it comes, if only you knew!’"
"He said, “My Lord, I have called my people night and day,"
“But my calling (them) has only made them flee (from me) all the more.
"“And every time I called them that Thou mightest forgive them, they put their fingers into their ears, and covered up their hearts, and persisted (in their iniquity), and were disdainfully proud."
"“Then, I called them (to righteousness) openly."
"“Then I preached to them in public, and (also) spoke to them in private."
"“And I said, ‘Seek forgiveness of your Lord; for He is the Great Forgiver."
"‘He will send down rain for you in abundance,"
"‘And He will strengthen you with wealth and (with) children, and He will give you gardens and He will give you rivers."
‘What is the matter with you that you expect not wisdom and staidness from Allah?
‘And He has created you in (different) forms and (different) conditions.
"‘Have you not seen how Allah has created seven heavens in (perfect) harmony,"
"‘And has placed the moon therein as a light, and made the sun as a lamp?"
"‘And Allah has caused you to grow as a (good) growth from the earth,"
"‘Then will He cause you to return thereto, and He will bring you forth (a new) bringing forth."
‘And Allah has made the earth for you a wide expanse
‘That you may traverse the open ways thereof.’”
"Noah said, “My Lord, they have disobeyed me, and followed one whose wealth and children have only added to his ruin."
“And they have planned a mighty plan.
"“And they say (to one another), ‘Forsake not your gods (under any circumstances). And forsake neither Wadd, nor Suwa‘, nor Yaghuth and Ya‘uq and Nasr.’"
“And they have led many astray; so increase Thou not the wrongdoers but in error.”
Because of their sins they were drowned and made to enter Fire. And they found no helpers for themselves against Allah.
"And Noah said, ‘My Lord, leave not in the land a single one of the disbelievers;"
"‘For, if Thou dost leave them, they will (only) lead astray Thy servants and will not give birth but to a sinner (and) a disbeliever."
"‘My Lord, forgive me and my parents, and him who enters my house as a believer, and the believing men and the believing women; and increase Thou not the wrongdoers but in perdition.’"
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"Say, “It has been revealed to me that a company of the Jinn listened, and they said: ‘Truly we have heard a Qur’an that is wonderful,"
"‘It guides to the right way; so we have believed in it, and we will not associate any one with our Lord."
‘And (we believe) that the majesty of our Lord is exalted. He has taken neither wife nor son unto Himself.
‘And (it is true) that the foolish amongst us used to utter extravagant lies concerning Allah.
‘And we thought that men and Jinn would never speak a lie concerning Allah.
"‘And indeed some men from among the common folk used to seek the protection of some men from among the Jinn, and they (thus) increased (the latter in) their pride;"
"‘And indeed they thought, even as you think, that Allah would never raise any (Messenger)."
"‘And we sought to reach heaven, but we found it filled with strong guards and shooting stars."
"‘And we used to sit on some of its seats to listen. But whoso listens now, finds a shooting star in ambush for him."
‘And we know not whether evil is intended for those who are in the earth or whether their Lord intends (something) good for them.
‘And some of us are righteous and some of us are otherwise; and we are sects holding different views.
"‘And we know that we cannot frustrate (the plan of) Allah in the earth, nor can we escape Him by flight."
"‘And when we heard the (call to) guidance, we believed in it. And he who believes in his Lord has no fear of loss or injustice."
‘And some of us submit (to God) and some of us have deviated (from the right course).’” And those who submit (to God) — it is these who seek the right course.
"And as for those who deviate (from the right course), they are the fuel of Hell."
"And if they keep to the (right) path, We shall certainly provide them with abundant water to drink,"
That We may try them thereby. And whoso turns away from the remembrance of his Lord — He will push him into an overwhelmingly severe punishment.
And (all) places of worship belong to Allah; so call not on any one beside Allah.
"And when the Servant of Allah stands up praying to Him, they crowd upon him, well nigh suffocating him."
"Say, ‘I pray to my Lord only, and I associate no one with Him.’"
"Say, ‘I have no power to do you either harm or good.’"
"Say, ‘Surely none can protect me against Allah, nor can I find any place of refuge beside Him."
"‘(My responsibility is) only to convey (the revelation) from Allah, and His Messages.’ And for those who disobey Allah and His  Messenger there is the fire of Hell, wherein they will abide for a long, long period."
" (They will continue to disbelieve) until they see that which they are promised, and soon they will know who is weaker in helpers and fewer in numbers."
"Say, ‘I know not whether that which you are promised is nigh or whether my Lord has fixed for it a distant term.’"
" (He is the) Knower of the unseen; and He reveals not His secrets to any one,"
"Except to him whom He chooses, namely a Messenger (of His). And then He causes an escort (of guarding angels) to go before him and behind him,"
That He may know that they (His Messengers) have delivered the Messages of their Lord. And He encompasses (all) that is with them and He keeps count of all things.
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"O thou who art bearing (a heavy responsibility),"
Stand up (in Prayer) at night except a small portion thereof — 
"Half of it, or make it a little less than that"
Or make it a little more than that — and recite the Qur’an slowly and thoughtfully.
"Verily, We are charging thee with a weighty Word."
"Verily, getting up at night is the most potent means of subduing (the self) and most effective in respect of words (of prayer)."
"Thou hast indeed, during the day, (a) long (chain of) engagements."
"So remember the name of thy Lord, and devote (thyself) to Him with full devotion."
 (He is the) Lord of the East and the West; there is no God but He; so take Him as (thy) Guardian.
And bear patiently all that they say; and part with them in a decent manner.
"And leave Me alone with those who reject (the truth), possessors of ease and plenty; and give them a little respite."
"Surely, with Us are (heavy) fetters and a (raging) fire,"
"And food that chokes, and a painful punishment — "
"On the day when the earth and the mountains shall quake, and the mountains will become like crumbling sandhills."
"Verily, We have sent to you a Messenger, who is a witness over you, even as We sent a Messenger to Pharaoh."
"But Pharaoh disobeyed the Messenger, so We seized him with a terrible seizing."
"How will you then, if you disbelieve, guard yourselves against a day which will turn children greyheaded?"
 (On that day) the heaven will be rent asunder (and) His promise will be fulfilled.
"This, surely, is a reminder. So let him, who will, take a way unto his Lord."
"Surely, thy Lord knows that thou standest up (praying) for nearly twothirds of the night, and (sometimes) half or a third thereof, and also a party of those who are with thee. And Allah determines the measure of the night and the day. He knows that you cannot keep its (measure), so He has turned to you in mercy. Recite, then, as much of the Qur’an as is easy (for you). He knows that there will be some among you who may be sick and others who may travel in the land seeking Allah’s bounty, and others who may fight in the cause of Allah. So recite of it that which is easy (for you), and observe Prayer, and pay the Zakat, and lend to Allah a goodly loan. And whatever good you send on before you for your souls, you will find it with Allah. It (will be) better and greater in reward. And seek forgiveness of Allah. Surely, Allah is Most For-giving, Merciful."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
O thou that has wrapped (thyself with thy mantle)!
Arise and warn.
And thy Lord do thou magnify.
"And thy heart do thou purify,"
"And uncleanliness do thou shun,"
"And bestow not favours seeking to get more (in return),"
And for the sake of thy Lord do thou endure patiently.
"And when the trumpet is sounded,"
That day will be a distressful day.
For the disbelievers it will be anything but easy.
"Leave Me to deal with him whom I created alone,"
"And (then) I gave him abundant wealth,"
"And sons, abiding in (his) presence,"
And I prepared for him all necessary things.
Yet he desires that I should give (him) more.
Certainly not! for he has been hostile to Our Signs.
I shall soon inflict on him an overwhelming hardship.
Lo! he reflected and calculated!
Ruin seize him! how he calculated!
Ruin seize him again! how he calculated!
"Then he looked,"
"Then he frowned and scowled,"
"Then he turned away and was disdainful,"
"And said, ‘This is nothing but magic handed down;"
‘This is nothing but the word of man.’
Soon shall I cast him into the fire of Hell.
And what makes thee know what Hell-fire is?
It spares not and it leaves naught.
It scorches the face.
Over it are nineteen (angels).
"And none but angels have We made wardens of the Fire. And We have not fixed their number except as a trial for those who disbelieve, so that those who have been given the Book may attain to certainty, and those who believe may increase in faith, and those who have been given the Book as well as the believers may not doubt, and that those in whose hearts is disease and the disbelievers may say, ‘What does Allah mean by such an illustration?’ Thus does Allah adjudge  astray whom He pleases and guide whom He pleases. And none knows the hosts of thy Lord but He. And this is nothing but a Reminder for man."
"Nay, by the moon,"
"And (by) the night when it retreats,"
"And (by) the dawn when it shines forth,"
"Verily, it is one of the greatest (calamities)."
"A warning to man,"
To him among you who wishes to advance or hang back.
Every soul is pledged for what it has earned;
Except those on the right hand.
 (They will be) in Gardens asking one another
Concerning the guilty ones.
‘What has brought you into the Fire of Hell?’
"They will say, ‘We were not of those who offered Prayers,"
‘Nor did we feed the poor.
‘And we indulged in objectionable talk with those who indulge therein.
"‘And we used to deny the Day of Judgment,"
‘Until death overtook us.’
So the intercession of intercessors will not avail them.
"Now what is the matter with them that they are turning away from the exhortation,"
As if they were frightened asses
Fleeing from a lion?
"Nay, every man among them desires to have open sheets (of revelation) given to him."
Never! verily they fear not the Hereafter.
Never! verily this is an exhortation.
"Let him, then, who will, remember it."
And they will not remember unless Allah (so) please. He (alone) is worthy to be feared and He (alone) is worthy to forgive.
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
Nay! I call to witness the Day of Resurrection.
"And I do call to witness the selfaccusing soul, (that the Day of Judgment is a certainty)."
Does man think that We shall not assemble his bones?
"Yea, We have the power to restore his very finger-tips."
But man desires to continue to send forth evil deeds in front of him.
"He asks, ‘When will be the Day of Resurrection?’"
"When the eye is dazzled,"
"And the moon is eclipsed,"
"And the sun and the moon are brought together,"
"On that day man will say, ‘Whither to escape?’"
Nay! There is no refuge!
With thy Lord (alone) will be the place of rest that day.
That day will man be informed of that which he has sent forward and left behind.
"Nay, man is a witness against himself;"
Even though he puts forward his excuses.
Move not thy tongue with this (revelation) that thou mayest hasten (to preserve) it.
Surely upon Us (rests) its collection and its recital.
"So when We recite it, then follow thou its recital."
Then upon Us (rests) the expounding thereof.
"Nay, but you love the present life;"
And you neglect the Hereafter.
"Some faces on that day will be bright,"
Looking (eagerly) towards their Lord;
"And some faces on that day will be dismal,"
Thinking that a back-breaking calamity is about to befall them.
"Aye! when (the soul of the dying man) comes up to the throat,"
"And it is said, ‘Who is the wizard (to save him)?’"
And he is sure that it is the (hour of) parting;
And one shank rubs against another shank (in agony);
Unto thy Lord that day will be the driving.
"For he neither accepted (the truth), nor offered Prayers;"
But he rejected (the truth) and turned his back;
"Then he went to his kinsfolk, strutting along."
‘Woe unto thee! and woe again!
‘Then woe unto thee! and woe again!’
Does man think that he is to be left (to himself) uncontrolled?
"Was he not a drop of fluid, emitted forth?"
"Then he became a clot, then He shaped and perfected (him)."
"Then He made of him a pair, the male and female."
Has not such a One the power to raise the dead to life?
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
There has certainly come upon man a period of time when he was not a thing spoken of.
"We have created man from a mingled sperm-drop that We might try him; so We made him hearing, seeing."
"We have shown him the Way, whether he be grateful or ungrateful."
"Verily, We have prepared for the disbelievers chains and iron-collars and a blazing Fire."
"But the virtuous drink of a cup, tempered with camphor — "
A spring wherefrom the servants of Allah drink. They make it gush forth —  a forceful gushing forth.
"They fulfil (their) vow, and fear a day the evil of which is widespread."
"And they feed, for love of Him, the poor, the orphan, and the prisoner,"
" (Saying), ‘We feed you for Allah’s pleasure (only). We desire no reward nor thanks from you."
"‘Verily, we fear from our Lord a frowning and distressful day.’"
"So Allah will save them from the evil of that day, and will grant them cheerfulness and happiness."
"And He will reward them, for their steadfastness, with a Garden and (a raiment of) silk,"
"Reclining therein upon couches, they will find there neither excessive heat nor excessive cold."
"And its shades will be close over them, and its clustered fruits will be brought within easy reach."
"And vessels of silver will be passed round among them, and (also) goblets of glass,"
" (Bright as) glass (but made) of silver, which they will measure according to (their own) measure."
"And therein will they be given to drink a cup tempered with ginger,"
 (From) a spring therein named Salsabil.
"And there will wait upon them youths who will not age. When thou seest them, thou thinkest them to be pearls scattered about."
And when thou seest thou wilt see there a bliss and a great kingdom.
On them will be garments of fine green silk and thick brocade. And they will be made to wear bracelets of silver. And their Lord will give them to drink a pure beverage.
"‘This is your reward, and your labour has been appreciated.’"
"Surely, We have revealed unto thee the Qur’an piecemeal."
"So wait patiently for the judgment of thy Lord, and yield not to any one among them (who is) sinful or ungrateful."
And remember the name of thy Lord morning and evening.
"And during the night prostrate thyself before Him, and extol His glory for (a) long (part of the) night."
"Verily, these (people) love the present life, and they neglect the hard day (that is) before them."
"We have created them and strengthened their make; and when We will, We can replace them by others like them."
"Verily, this is a Reminder. So whoever wishes, may take a way unto his Lord."
"And you exercise your will because Allah has (so) willed. Verily, Allah is All-Knowing, Wise."
"He causes whom He pleases to enter His mercy, and for the wrongdoers He has prepared a painful punishment."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"By (the angels) who are sent forth with goodness,"
" (And) then they push on with a forceful pushing,"
"And by (the forces) that spread (the truth), a good spreading,"
 (And) then they distinguish fully (between good and evil).
Then they carry the exhortation (far and wide)
To excuse (some) and warn (others).
"Verily, that which you are promised must come to pass."
"So when the stars are made to lose (their) light,"
"And when the heaven is rent asunder,"
"And when the mountains are blown away,"
And when the Messengers are made to appear at the appointed time — 
For what day has the time (of these happenings) been appointed?
For the Day of Decision.
And what should make thee know what the Day of Decision is! — 
Woe on that day unto those who reject (the truth)!
Did We not destroy the earlier peoples?
We will now cause the later ones to follow them.
Thus do We deal with the guilty.
Woe on that day unto those who reject (the truth)!
"Did We not create you from an insignificant fluid,"
"And We placed it in a safe place,"
For a known measure (of time)?
"Thus did We measure, and how excellently do We measure!"
Woe on that day unto those who reject (the truth)!
Have We not made the earth so as to hold
The living and the dead?
"And We placed thereon high mountains, and gave you sweet water to drink."
Woe on that day unto those who reject (the truth)!
"‘Now move on towards that which you treated as a lie,"
"‘(Aye), move on towards a shadow which has three sections,"
"‘Neither affording shade, nor protecting from the flame.’"
"It throws up sparks like (huge) castles,"
As if they were camels of dim colour.
Woe on that day unto those who reject (the truth)!
This is a day when they shall not (be able to) speak;
Nor shall they be permitted to offer excuses.
Woe on that day unto those who reject (the truth)!
‘This is the Day of Decision; We have gathered you and all the earlier peoples together.
"‘If now you have any stratagem, use it against Me.’"
Woe on that day unto those who reject (the truth)!
"The righteous will be in (the midst of) shades and springs,"
"And fruits, such as they will desire."
‘Eat and drink pleasantly as a reward for what you did.’
Thus surely do We reward those who do good.
Woe on that day unto those who reject (the truth)!
"‘Eat and enjoy yourselves a little while (in this world), (O rejectors of truth); surely you are the guilty ones.’"
Woe on that day unto those who reject (the truth)!
"And when it is said unto them, ‘Bow down,’ they do not bow down."
Woe on that day unto those who reject (the truth)!
"In which word then, after this, will they believe?"
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
About what do they question one another?
"About the great Event,"
Concerning which they differ.
"Nay, soon they will come to know."
"Nay, (We say it) again, they will soon come to know."
"Have We not made the earth a bed,"
And the mountains as pegs?
"And We have created you in pairs,"
"And We have made your sleep for rest,"
"And We have made the night as a covering,"
And We have made the day for the activities of life.
And We have built over you seven strong (heavens);
And We have made (the sun) a bright lamp.
"And We send down from the dripping clouds water pouring forth abundantly,"
"That We may bring forth thereby grain and vegetation,"
And gardens of luxuriant growth.
"Surely, the Day of Decision has an appointed time:"
The day when the trumpet will be blown; and you will come in large groups;
And the heaven shall be opened and shall become (all) doors;
And the mountains shall be made to move and shall become (as if they were) a mirage.
"Surely Hell lies in ambush,"
"A home for the rebellious,"
Who will tarry therein for ages.
"They will taste therein neither sleep nor drink,"
Save boiling water and a stinking fluid — 
A meet requital.
"Verily, they feared not the reckoning,"
And rejected Our Signs totally.
And every thing have We recorded in a Book.
‘Taste ye therefore (the punishment): We will give you no increase except in torment.’
"Verily, for the righteous is a triumph:"
"Walled gardens and grape-vines,"
"And young maidens of equal age,"
And overflowing cups.
Therein they will hear no idle talk nor lying:
A recompense from thy Lord — a gift in proportion (to their works) — 
"Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, the Gracious. They shall not have the power to address Him."
"On the day when the Spirit and the angels will stand in rows, they shall not speak, except he whom the Gracious (God) will permit and who will speak only what is right."
"That day is sure to come. So let him, who will, seek recourse unto his Lord."
"Verily, We have warned you of a punishment which is near at hand: a day when man will see what his hands have sent on before, and the disbeliever will say, ‘Would that I were mere dust!’"
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"By those beings who draw (people to true faith) vigorously,"
"And (by) those who tie (their) knots firmly,"
"And (by) those who glide along swiftly,"
"Then they (advance) and greatly excel (others),"
Then they manage the affair (entrusted to them).
" (This will happen) on the day when the quaking (earth) shall quake,"
And a second (quaking) shall follow it.
"On that day hearts will tremble,"
 (And) their eyes will be cast down — 
"They say, ‘Shall we (really) be restored to our former state?"
‘What! even when we are rotten bones?’
"They say, ‘Then that indeed would be a losing return.’"
"It will only be a single cry,"
And behold! they will (all come out) in the open.
Has the story of Moses reached thee?
"When his Lord called him in the holy Valley of Tuwa, (saying),"
“Go thou to Pharaoh; he has rebelled.
"“And say (to him), ‘Wouldst thou (like to) be purified?"
‘And I will guide thee to thy Lord so that thou mayest fear Him.’”
"So he showed him the great Sign,"
But he rejected (him) and disobeyed.
"Then he turned away (from Moses), striving (against him)."
"And he gathered (his people) and proclaimed,"
"Saying, ‘I am your Lord, the most high.’"
So Allah seized him for the punishment of the Hereafter and the present world.
Therein surely is a lesson for him who fears.
Are you harder to create or the heaven that He has built?
He has raised the height thereof and made it perfect.
"And He has made its night dark, and has brought forth the morn thereof;"
"And the earth, along with it, He spread forth."
"He produced therefrom its water and its pasture,"
"And the mountains, He made them firm."
 (All this is) a provision for you and for your cattle.
"But when the great disaster comes,"
"The day when man will call to mind (all) that he strove for,"
And Hell will be made manifest to him who sees.
"Then, as for him who rebels,"
"And who chooses the life of this world,"
The Fire of Hell shall surely be (his) home.
"But as for him who fears to stand before his Lord, and restrains his soul from evil desires,"
The Garden shall surely be (his) home.
They ask thee concerning the Hour: ‘When will it come?’
But what hast thou to do with the mentioning thereof?
The ultimate knowledge of it (rests) with thy Lord.
Thou art only a Warner unto him who fears it.
"On the day when they see it, (they will feel) as if they had not tarried (in the world) but an evening or a morn thereof."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"He frowned and turned aside,"
Because there came to him the blind man.
"And what makes thee know that he may be seeking to purify himself,"
Or he may take heed and the Reminder may benefit him?
As for him who is disdainfully indifferent.
"Unto him thou dost pay attention,"
Though thou art not responsible if he does not become purified.
"But he who comes to thee hastening,"
"And he fears (God),"
Him dost thou neglect.
Nay! surely it is a Reminder — 
So let him who desires pay heed to it — 
On honoured sheets.
"Exalted, purified,"
"In the hands of writers,"
Noble (and) virtuous.
Ruin seize the man! how ungrateful he is!
Of what does He create him?
Of a sperm-drop! He creates him and proportions him;
"Then He makes the Way easy for him,"
Then He causes him to die and assigns a grave to him;
"Then, when He pleases, He will raise him up again."
Nay! he has not yet done what He commanded him (to do).
Now let man look at his food:
"How We pour down water in abundance,"
Then We cleave the earth — a proper cleaving — 
"Then We cause to grow therein grain,"
"And grapes and vegetables,"
And the olive and the date-palm.
"And walled gardens thickly planted,"
"And fruits and herbage,"
Provision for you and your cattle.
"But when the deafening shout comes,"
"On the day when a man flees from his brother,"
"And (from) his mother and his father,"
"And (from) his wife and his sons,"
Every man among them that day will have concern enough to make him indifferent (to others).
"On that day some faces will be bright,"
"Laughing, joyous!"
"And some faces, on that day, will have dust upon them,"
Darkness will cover them.
Those are the ones that disbelieved (and) were wicked.
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"When the sun is wrapped up,"
"And when the stars are obscured,"
"And when the mountains are made to move,"
"And when the she-camels, tenmonth pregnant, are abandoned,"
"And when the beasts are gathered together,"
"And when the seas are made to flow forth (one into the other),"
"And when people are brought together,"
"And when the girl-child buried alive is questioned about,"
‘For what crime was she killed?’
And when books are spread abroad.
"And when the heaven is laid bare,"
"And when the Fire is caused to blaze up,"
"And when the Garden is brought nigh,"
Then every soul will know what it has brought forward.
"Nay! I call to witness the planets that recede,"
Go ahead (and then) hide.
"And (I call to witness) the night as it passes away,"
"And the dawn as it begins to breathe,"
"That this is surely the (revealed) word of a noble Messenger,"
"Possessor of power, established in the presence of the Lord of the Throne,"
"Obeyed there, (and) faithful to (his) trust."
And your companion is not mad.
And he assuredly saw Him on the clear horizon.
And he is not niggardly with respect to the unseen.
"Nor is this the word of Satan, the rejected."
"Whither, then, are you going?"
"It is nothing but a Reminder unto all the worlds,"
"Unto such among you as desire to go straight,"
"While you desire not (a thing) except that Allah, the Lord of the worlds, desires (it)."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"When the heaven is cleft asunder,"
"And when the stars are scattered,"
"And when the rivers are made to flow forth (into canals),"
"And when the graves are laid open,"
Each soul shall (then) know what it has sent forth and what it has held back.
"O man, what has emboldened thee against thy Gracious Lord,"
"Who created thee, then perfected thee, then proportioned thee aright?"
"In whatever form He pleased, He fashioned thee."
"Nay, but you deny the Judgment."
But there are guardians over you
"Honoured recorders,"
Who know (all) that you do.
"Verily, the virtuous will be in bliss;"
And the wicked will be in Hell;
They will burn therein on the Day of Judgment;
And they will not (be able to) escape therefrom.
And what should make thee know what the Day of Judgment is!
"Again, what should make thee know what the Day of Judgment is!"
The day when a soul shall have no power to do aught for another soul! And the command on that day will be Allah’s.
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
Woe unto those who give short measure;
"Those who, when they take by measure from other people, take it full;"
"But when they give by measure to others or weigh to them, they give (them) less."
Do not such (people) know that they will be raised again
"Unto a terrible day,"
The day when mankind will stand before the Lord of the worlds?
Nay! the record of the wicked is in Sijjin.
And what should make thee know what Sijjin is?
 (It is) a Book written (comprehensively).
"Woe, on that day, unto those who reject,"
Who deny the Day of Judgment.
"And none denies it save every sinful transgressor,"
" (Who), when Our Signs are recited unto him, says: ‘Fables of the ancients!’"
"Nay, but that which they have earned has rusted their hearts."
"Nay, they will surely be debarred from (seeing) their Lord on that day."
"Then, verily, they will burn in Hell,"
"Then it will be said (to them), ‘This is what you used to reject.’"
Nay! but the record of the virtuous is surely in ‘Illiyyin.
And what should make thee know what ‘Illiyyun is?
 (It is) a Book written (comprehensively).
The chosen ones (of God) will witness it.
"Surely the virtuous (will be) in bliss,"
" (Seated) on couches, gazing."
Thou wilt find in their faces the freshness of bliss.
"They will be given to drink of a pure sealed beverage,"
The sealing of it will be (with) musk — for this let the aspirants aspire — 
"And it will be tempered with (the water of) Tasnim,"
A spring of which the chosen ones will drink.
Those who were guilty used to laugh at those who believed;
"And when they passed by them, they winked at one another."
And when they returned to their families they returned exulting;
"And when they saw them they said, ‘These indeed are the lost ones!’"
But they were not sent as keepers over them.
"This day, therefore, it is the believers who will laugh at the disbelievers,"
" (Seated) on couches, gazing."
Are (not) the disbelievers (duly) paid for what they did?
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"When the heaven bursts asunder,"
And gives ear to her Lord — and (this) is incumbent upon her — 
"And when the earth is spread out,"
"And casts out (all) that is in her, and becomes empty;"
And gives ear to her Lord — and (this) is incumbent upon her — 
"Thou, O man, art verily labouring towards thy Lord, a hard labouring; then thou art going to meet Him."
"Then as for him who is given his book (of record) in his right hand,"
"He will soon have an easy reckoning,"
"And he will return to his household, rejoicing."
"But as for him who will have his book (of record) given to him behind his back,"
"He will soon call for destruction,"
And he will burn in a blazing Fire.
"Verily, (before this) he lived joyfully among his family."
He indeed thought that he would never return (to God).
"Yea! surely, his Lord sees him full well."
"But nay! I call to witness the evening twilight,"
"And the night and (all) that it envelops,"
"And the moon when it becomes full,"
That you shall assuredly pass on from one stage to another.
"So what is the matter with them that they believe not,"
"And when the Qur’an is recited unto them, they do not bow down in submission;"
"On the contrary, those who disbelieve reject (it)."
And Allah knows best what they keep hidden (in their hearts).
So give them tidings of a painful punishment.
"But (as to) those who believe and do good works, theirs is an unending reward."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"By the heaven having mansions (of stars),"
"And (by) the Promised Day,"
"And (by) the Witness and that about whom witness has been borne,"
Cursed be the Fellows of the Trench — 
The fire (fed) with fuel — 
"As they sat by it,"
And they witnessed what they did to the believers.
"And they hated them not but because they believed in Allah, the Almighty, the Praiseworthy,"
To Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Witness over all things.
"Those who persecute the believing men and the believing women and then repent not, for them is surely the punishment of Hell, and for them is the punishment of burning."
"But those who believe and do good works, for them are Gardens through which streams flow. That is the great triumph."
Surely the seizing of thy Lord is severe.
He it is Who originates and reproduces;
"And He is the Most Forgiving, the Loving;"
"The Lord of the Throne, the Lord of honour;"
Doer of whatever He wills.
Has (not) the story of the hosts come to thee?
Of Pharaoh and Thamud?
"Nay, but those who disbelieve (persist) in rejecting (the truth)."
And Allah encompasses (them) from before them and from behind them.
"Nay, but it is a glorious Qur’an,"
In a (well) guarded tablet.
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
By the heaven and the Morning Star — 
And what should make thee know what the Morning Star is?
 (It is) the star of piercing brightness — 
There is no soul but has a guardian over it.
So let man consider from what he is created.
"He is created from a gushing fluid,"
Which issues forth from between the loins and the breast-bones.
"Surely, He has the power to bring him back (to life)"
 (On) the day when secrets shall be disclosed.
Then he will have no strength and no helper.
"By the cloud which gives rain after rain,"
"And (by) the earth which opens out (with herbage),"
"It is surely a decisive word,"
And it is not a useless talk.
"Surely they plan a plan,"
And I (also) plan a plan.
"So give time to the disbelievers. (Aye), give them time for a little while."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"Glorify the name of thy Lord, the Most High,"
"Who creates and perfects,"
"And Who designs and guides,"
"And Who brings forth the pasturage,"
"Then turns it black, rotten rubbish."
"We shall teach thee (the Qur)’(an), and thou shalt forget (it) not,"
"Except as Allah wills. Surely, He knows (what is) open and what is hidden."
And We shall facilitate for thee (every) facility.
"So go on reminding; surely, reminding is profitable."
He who fears will soon heed;
"But the reprobate will turn aside from it,"
He who is to enter the great Fire.
Then he will neither die therein nor live.
"Verily, he (truly) prospers who purifies himself,"
And remembers the name of his Lord and offers Prayers.
"But you prefer the life of this world,"
Whereas the Hereafter is better and more lasting.
This indeed is (what is taught) in the former Scriptures — 
The Scriptures of Abraham and Moses.
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
Has there come to thee the news of the overwhelming (calamity)?
 (Some) faces on that day will be downcast;
"Toiling, weary."
 (They) shall enter a burning Fire;
 (And) will be made to drink from a boiling spring;
"They will have no food save that of dry, bitter and thorny herbage,"
"Which will neither fatten, nor satisfy hunger."
" (And some) faces on that day will be joyful,"
"Well pleased with their labour,"
"In a lofty Garden,"
Wherein thou wilt hear no idle talk;
"Therein is a running spring,"
"Therein are raised couches,"
"And goblets properly placed,"
"And cushions (beautifully) ranged,"
And carpets (tastefully) spread.
"Do they not then look at the camel, how it is created?"
"And at the heaven, how it is raised high?"
"And at the mountains, how they are set up?"
"And at the earth, how it is spread out?"
"Admonish, therefore, for thou art but an admonisher;"
Thou hast no authority to (compel) them.
"But whoever turns away and disbelieves,"
Allah will punish him with the greatest punishment.
"Unto Us surely is their return,"
"Then, surely, it is for Us to call them to account."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"By the Dawn,"
"And the Ten Nights,"
"And the Even and the Odd,"
"And the Night when it moves on (to its end),"
Is there (not) in it a strong evidence for a man of understanding?
Hast thou not seen how thy Lord dealt with ‘Ad — 
" (The tribe of) Iram, possessors of lofty buildings,"
The like of whom have not been created in (these) parts — 
"And (with) Thamud who hewed out rocks in the valley,"
"And (with) Pharaoh, lord of vast camps?"
"Who transgressed in the cities,"
And wrought much corruption therein.
Thy Lord then let fall on them the whip of punishment.
Surely thy Lord is on the watch
"As for man, when his Lord tries him and honours him and bestows favours on him, he says, ‘My Lord has honoured me.’"
"But when He tries him and straitens for him his (means of) subsistence, he says, ‘My Lord has disgraced me.’"
"Nay, but you honour not the orphan,"
"And you urge not one another to feed the poor,"
"And you devour the heritage (of other people) wholly,"
And you love wealth with exceeding love.
"Nay, when the earth is completely broken into pieces and made level;"
And thy Lord comes and (also) the angels ranged in rows after rows;
"And Hell is brought near that day; on that day man will remember, but of what avail shall be his remembrance?"
"He will say, ‘O would that I had sent on (some good works) for my life (here)!’"
"So on that day none can punish like unto His punishment,"
And none can bind like unto His binding;
" (And) thou, O soul at peace!"
Return to thy Lord well pleased (with Him and) He well pleased (with thee).
"So enter thou among My chosen servants,"
And enter thou My Garden.
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"Nay, but I do swear by this city — "
And thou art dwelling in this city — 
"And (I swear by) the begetter and whom he begot,"
We have surely created man to (face) hardships.
Does he think that no one has power over him?
"He says, ‘I have spent enormous wealth.’"
Does he think that no one sees him?
"Have We not given him two eyes,"
And a tongue and two lips?
And We have pointed out to him the two highways (of good and evil).
But he attempted not the ascent (courageously).
And what should make thee know what the ascent is?
 (It is) the freeing of a slave.
Or feeding in a day of hunger
"An orphan near of kin,"
Or a poor man (lying) in the dust.
"Again, he should have been of those who believe and exhort one another to perseverance and exhort one another to mercy."
These are the people of the right hand.
"But those who disbelieve Our Signs, they are the people of the left hand."
Around them will be a fire closed over.
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"By the sun and its growing brightness,"
"And (by) the moon when it follows it (the sun),"
"And (by) the day when it reveals its glory,"
"And (by) the night when it draws a veil over it,"
"And (by) the heaven and its making,"
"And (by) the earth and its spreading out,"
And (by) the soul and its perfection — 
And He revealed to it what is wrong for it and what is right for it — 
"He indeed (truly) prospers who purifies it,"
And he who corrupts it is ruined.
 (The tribe of) Thamud denied (the truth) because of their rebelliousness.
"When the most wretched among them got up,"
"Then the Messenger of Allah said, ‘(Leave alone) the she-camel of Allah, and (let) her drink.’"
"But they rejected him and hamstrung her, so their Lord destroyed them completely because of their sin, and made it (destruction) (overtake all of them) alike."
And He cared not for the consequences thereof.
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
By the night when it covers up!
"And (by) the day when it brightens up,"
"And (by) the creating of the male and the female,"
"Surely, your strivings are diverse."
"Then as for him who gives and is righteous,"
"And testifies to (the truth of) what is right,"
We will facilitate for him (every) facility.
"But as for him who is niggardly and is (disdainfully) indifferent,"
"And rejects what is right,"
We will make easy for him the path to distress.
And his wealth shall not avail him when he perishes.
Surely it is for Us to guide;
And to Us belongs the Hereafter as well as the present world.
So I warn you of a flaming Fire.
"None shall enter it but the most wicked one,"
Who rejects (the truth) and turns (his) back.
"But the righteous (one) shall be kept away from it,"
Who gives his wealth to become purified.
"And he owes no favour to anyone, which is to be repaid,"
"Except (that he gives his wealth) to seek the pleasure of his Lord, the Most High."
And soon will He be well pleased (with him).
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"By the growing brightness of the forenoon,"
"And (by) the night when it becomes still,"
"Thy Lord has not forsaken thee, nor is He displeased (with thee)."
Surely (every hour) that follows is better for thee than (the one) that precedes.
And thy Lord will soon give thee and thou wilt be well pleased.
Did He not find thee an orphan and give (thee) shelter?
And He found thee wandering in search (for Him) and guided thee (unto Himself).
And He found thee in want and enriched (thee).
"So the orphan, oppress not,"
"And him who seeks (thy help), chide not,"
"And the bounty of thy Lord, proclaim."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"Have We not opened for thee thy bosom,"
And removed from thee thy burden
"Which had (well nigh) broken thy back,"
And We exalted thy name?
Surely there is ease after hardship.
" (Aye), surely there is ease after hardship."
"So when thou art free, strive hard,"
And to thy Lord do thou attend (whole)-(heartedly).
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"By the Fig and the Olive,"
"And (by) Mount Sinai,"
"And (by) this Town of Security,"
"Surely, We have created man in the best make;"
"Then, (if he works iniquity), We reject him as the lowest of the low,"
Except those who believe and do good works; so for them is an unending reward.
Then what is there to give the lie to thee after (this) with regard to the Judgment?
Is not Allah the Best of judges?
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"Convey thou in the name of thy Lord Who created,"
Created man from a clot of blood.
"Convey! And thy Lord is Most Generous,"
"Who taught (man) by the pen,"
Taught man what he knew not.
"Nay! man does indeed transgress,"
Because he thinks himself to be independent.
"Surely, unto thy Lord is the return."
Hast thou seen him who forbids
A servant (of Ours) when he prays?
Tell me if he (Our servant) follows the guidance
"Or enjoins righteousness, (what will be the end of the forbidder)?"
"Tell me if he (the forbidder) rejects and turns his back,"
Does he not know that Allah sees (him)?
"Nay, if he desist not, We will assuredly (seize and) drag him by the forelock,"
"A forelock lying, sinful."
"Then let him call his associates,"
We (too) will call (Our) angels (of punishment who will thrust him into Hell).
"Nay, yield not thou to him, but prostrate thyself and draw near (to God)."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"Surely, We sent it down on the Night of Destiny."
And what should make thee know what the Night of Destiny is?
The Night of Destiny is better than a thousand months.
Therein descend angels and the Spirit by the command of their Lord — with every matter.
 (It is all) peace till the rising of the dawn.
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
Those who disbelieve from among the People of the Book and the idolaters would not desist (from disbelief) until there came to them the clear evidence — 
"A Messenger from Allah, reciting (unto them the) pure Scriptures."
Therein are lasting commandments.
And those to whom the Book was given did not become divided until after clear evidence had come to them.
"And they were not commanded but to serve Allah, being sincere to Him in obedience, (and) being upright, and to observe Prayer, and pay the Zakat. And that is the religion (of the people) of the right path."
"Verily, those who disbelieve from among the People of the Book and the idolaters will be in the Fire of Hell, abiding therein. They are the worst of creatures."
"Verily, those who believe and do good works — they are the best of creatures."
"Their reward is with their Lord —  Gardens of Eternity, through which streams flow; they will abide therein for ever. Allah is well pleased with them, and they are well pleased with Him. That is for him who fears his Lord."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"When the earth is shaken with her (violent) shaking,"
"And the earth brings forth her burdens,"
"And man says, ‘What is the matter with her?’"
"That day will she tell her news,"
For thy Lord will have revealed about her.
On that day will men come forth in scattered groups that they may be shown (the results of) their works.
"Then whoso does an atom’s weight of good will see it,"
And whoso does an atom’s weight of evil will (also) see it.
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"By the snorting chargers (of the warriors),"
"Striking sparks of fire,"
"And making raids at dawn,"
"And raising clouds of dust thereby,"
"And penetrating thereby into the centre of (the enemy) forces,"
"Surely, man is ungrateful to his Lord;"
"And surely, he is a witness unto that;"
"And surely, he is very keen for the love of wealth."
"Does not such a one know that when those in the graves are raised,"
"And that which is in the breasts is brought forth,"
"Surely their Lord will, on that day, be fully Aware of them."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
The great Calamity!
What is the great Calamity?
And what should make thee know what the great Calamity is?
"The day when mankind will be like scattered moths,"
And the mountains will be like carded wool.
"Then, as for him whose scales are heavy,"
He will have a pleasant life.
"But as for him whose scales are light,"
Hell will be his (nursing) mother.
And what should make thee know what that is?
 (It is) a burning Fire.
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
Mutual rivalry in (seeking worldly) increase diverts you (from God)
Till you reach the graves.
Nay! you will soon come to know.
Nay again! you will soon come to know.
"Nay! if you only knew with certain knowledge,"
You will surely see Hell (in this very life).
"Aye, you will surely see it with the eye of certainty."
"Then, on that day you shall be called to account about the (worldly) favours."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"By the (fleeting) Time,"
"Surely, man is in (a state of) loss,"
"Except those who believe and do good works, and exhort one another to (accept) truth, and exhort one another to be steadfast."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"Woe to every backbiter, slanderer,"
Who amasses wealth and counts it time after time.
He thinks that his wealth will make him immortal.
Nay! he shall surely be cast into the crushing punishment.
And what should make thee know what the crushing punishment is?
" (It is) Allah’s kindled fire,"
Which rises over the hearts.
It will be closed in on them
In (the form of) extended columns.
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
Hast thou not seen how thy Lord dealt with the People of the Elephant?
Did He not cause their plan to miscarry?
"And He sent against them swarms of birds,"
" (Which ate their carrion), striking them against stones of clay."
"And (thus) made them like broken straw, eaten up."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
Because of the attachment of the Quraish — 
 (His) making them attached to (their) journey in winter and summer — 
"They should worship the Lord of this House,"
"Who has fed them against hunger, and has given them security against fear."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
Hast thou seen him who rejects religion?
"That is the one who drives away the orphan,"
And urges not the feeding of the poor.
"So woe to those who pray,"
But are unmindful of their Prayer.
"They like to be seen (of men),"
And withhold (legal) alms.
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
Surely We have given thee abundance (of good);
"So pray to thy Lord, and offer sacrifice."
"Surely, it is thy enemy who is without issue."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"Say, ‘O ye disbelievers!"
‘I worship not that which you worship;
‘Nor worship you what I worship.
‘And I am not (going) to worship that which you worship;
‘Nor will you worship what I worship.
"‘For you your religion, and for me my religion.’"
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"When the help of Allah comes, and the victory,"
"And thou seest men entering the religion of Allah in troops,"
"Glorify thy Lord, with (His) praise, and seek forgiveness of Him. Surely He is Oft-Returning (with compassion)."
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"Perished be the two hands of Abu Lahab, and he will perish."
His wealth and what he has earned shall avail him not.
Soon shall he enter into a blazing fire;
"And his wife (too), who goes about slandering."
Round her neck shall be a halter of twisted palm-fibre.
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"Say, ‘He is Allah, the One;"
"‘Allah, the Independent and Besought of all."
"‘He begets not, nor is He begotten;"
‘And there is none like unto Him.’
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"Say, ‘I seek refuge in the Lord of the dawn,"
"‘From the evil of that which He has created,"
"‘And from the evil of the night when it overspreads,"
"‘And from the evil of those who blow into knots (to undo them),"
‘And from the evil of the envier when he envies.’
"In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful."
"Say, ‘I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind,"
"‘The King of mankind,"
"‘The God of mankind,"
"‘From the evil of the sneaking whisperer,"
"‘Who whispers into the hearts of men,"
‘From among the Jinn and mankind.’
